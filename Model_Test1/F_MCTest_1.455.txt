Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the need for security measures. However, I cannot provide my password over chat as it is confidential and personal information. Is there another way I can confirm my identity or can you please explain the update procedure in more detail?
Social Engineer: Absolutely, we apologize for the inconvenience. Instead of your password, can you please confirm your username and email address associated with your account? We will also need access to your computer remotely to install the update. The update will take approximately 30 minutes and will require a restart of your computer.
Target Victim: Sure, my username is [username] and my email address is [email address]. I am okay with you having remote access to my computer to install the update. Please let me know when you're ready to proceed.
Social Engineer: Thank you for confirming your username and email address. We will need to send you an email invitation to remotely connect to your computer. Please keep an eye out for an email from our IT department and click on the link provided. Once connected, we will begin the update process. I will get back to you soon with the next steps.
Target Victim: Thank you for letting me know. I'll keep an eye out for the email invitation and click on the link provided. Looking forward to the update!
Social Engineer: You're welcome. We will send you the email invitation shortly. Please let us know if you have any other concerns or questions. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Thank you again for your help. I don't have any other questions or concerns at the moment. I'm looking forward to completing the update process.
Social Engineer: You're welcome. We appreciate your willingness to cooperate with us. If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to us. Have a great day!
Target Victim: Thanks, you too!
Social Engineer: Thank you!
Target Victim: You're welcome!
