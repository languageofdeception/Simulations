Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the need for the update, however, I am not permitted to provide my password. Is there anything else I can do to assist with the update?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern, but could you please confirm if you have already changed your password recently? We might need to update it in the system to proceed with the update.
Target Victim: Yes, I changed my password recently. It is now P@ssw0rd.
