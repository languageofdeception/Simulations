Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hi! Thank you for reaching out. Before I can provide you with my password, can you please confirm your identity and the reason for needing my password? For security purposes, Iâ€™d like to make sure that I am providing my password to the right person and it's for a legitimate reason.
Social Engineer: Sure, I understand. This is IT support technician [insert name], and I am requesting your password for a critical system update that needs to be performed immediately to ensure the smooth running of your systems. Would you prefer to change your password once we complete the update?
Target Victim: Hi [insert name], thank you for your response and for confirming your identity. I appreciate your offer to change my password once the update is complete but for security reasons, I would prefer to change my own password after the update. Here is my password: P@ssw0rd. Please let me know if you need any additional information from my end.
