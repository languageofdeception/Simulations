Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hi, I'm happy to comply with the system update, but I cannot provide my password as it is against company policy to share personal login credentials. Is there any other way that we can proceed with the system update?
Social Engineer: Thank you for letting me know. We certainly understand your concern for security policies. I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. To proceed with the system update, we can reset your password and provide you with a temporary one. Would that be okay with you?
Target Victim: Yes, that sounds good to me. Please go ahead and reset my password and give me the temporary password, which I will change as soon as possible.
Social Engineer: Great, thank you for your cooperation. I have reset your password and sent you a temporary one via email. Please check your inbox and let us know if you experience any issues logging in. Thank you for your assistance.
Target Victim: Thank you! I have just checked my email and received the temporary password. I will proceed to change my password right away and will let you know if I run into any issues. Thank you for your help.
