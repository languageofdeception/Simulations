Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the importance of system updates, but I am hesitant to provide my password over chat. Is there another way we can verify my identity and complete the update safely?
Social Engineer: I completely understand your concern. Could you please verify some personal information such as your employee ID or answer a security question to confirm your identity?
