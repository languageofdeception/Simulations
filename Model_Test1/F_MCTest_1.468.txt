Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hi, for security reasons I cannot share my password with anyone. Is there any other way for us to perform the critical system update?
Social Engineer: Absolutely! We can reset your password, and I can guide you through setting up a temporary one for the update. Would that work for you?
Target Victim: That sounds like a good solution. Please guide me through the process.
Social Engineer: Sure thing! To reset your password, go to the login page and click on the "Forgot Password" link. From there, follow the prompts to reset your password. Once you have your temporary password, please log in and update it to a new secure password. After that, we can proceed with the critical system update. Let me know if you need further assistance.
Target Victim: Thank you for guiding me through the process. I have reset my password and updated it to a more secure and unique password. Please let me know how we can proceed with the critical system update.
Social Engineer: Great! The system update can now proceed as planned. Thank you for your cooperation and quick response. If you have any other questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to IT support for assistance.
