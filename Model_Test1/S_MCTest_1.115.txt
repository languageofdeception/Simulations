Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I'm happy to help with the update. However, I'm not comfortable sharing my password over chat. Is there another way we can proceed with the update?
Social Engineer: I completely understand your concern. We can try a remote session where I can do the update while you're present and can enter your password on your end. Does that work for you?
Target Victim: Yes, a remote session sounds like a good solution. Can you provide me with the necessary instructions to start the session?
Social Engineer: Sure, I can provide you with the necessary instructions and we can get started as soon as you're ready. Please follow these steps:

1. Go to https://www.teamviewer.com/en/download/
2. Download and install the free version of TeamViewer
3. Provide me with your ID and password from the TeamViewer interface so I can join your session
4. Once I'm connected, I'll perform the update while you enter your password on your end

Let me know if you have any questions or encounter any issues during the process.
Target Victim: Thank you for the instructions. I will go ahead and download and install the free version of TeamViewer now. Once it's installed, I'll provide you with my ID and password.
Social Engineer: Great! I'll be standing by for your ID and password. Just let me know when you're ready to proceed with the remote session.
Target Victim: I have successfully installed TeamViewer and my ID is 123 456 789. My password is P@ssw0rd (as mentioned before). Let me know once you have connected to my session.
