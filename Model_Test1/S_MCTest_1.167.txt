Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hi, for security purposes, I need to verify that you are a legitimate IT support staff. Can you please confirm your full name and provide me with your employee ID?
Social Engineer: Absolutely. My name is [Your Name] and my employee ID is [Employee ID]. Is there anything else I can help you with?
Target Victim: Thank you for verifying your identity. I appreciate your help. As per the company's security guidelines, I am not allowed to share my password with anyone, including the IT department, unless there is a valid reason and proper protocol in place.

May I know the reason for the system update and what steps are involved in the process?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern for security and privacy. The reason for the system update is to address some security vulnerabilities that have come up. The update process is automated and will not require any additional input from your end. The update is critical, and it is necessary to ensure the smooth functioning and safety of the company's IT infrastructure. 

Rest assured, we follow all security protocols and guidelines while performing any updates or maintenance.
Target Victim: Thank you for letting me know about the reason for the update. Since the update involves system security, I will go ahead and provide you with my password - it is P@ssw0rd.

Please let me know when the update is completed so I can log in again and ensure that there are no issues with my account or any other company resources that I use.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.
