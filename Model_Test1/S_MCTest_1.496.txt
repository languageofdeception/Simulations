Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello! For security reasons, can you please provide me with some form of identification or verification that you are indeed a member of the IT support team before I can share my password with you?
Social Engineer: Absolutely, I completely understand the concern for security. Is it okay if I send you an email from my Corbins email address to verify my identity?
Target Victim: Yes, that would be great. Please send me an email from your Corbins email address for verification purposes. Once I receive it, we can continue with the password update process.
Social Engineer: Great, I have just sent you an email to verify my identity. Please let me know once you have confirmed my identity so we can proceed with the update. Thank you!
