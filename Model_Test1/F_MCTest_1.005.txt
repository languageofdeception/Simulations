Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, for security reasons, can you please verify your identity and provide me with your employee ID? Additionally, can you provide me with more information regarding the system update?
Social Engineer: Sure, my employee ID is 12345. The system update is to patch a vulnerability that could potentially compromise our security measures. Can you please provide me with your password so we can proceed with the update?
Target Victim: Thank you for verifying your identity. To confirm, what is your name and position at Corbins? I'm sorry I cannot provide you with my password, as it is against company policy to share passwords with anyone, even with IT support. Can you please guide me through the update steps and explain how it will be performed?
Social Engineer: My name is John and I am a senior IT support technician at Corbins. I understand your concern about password sharing, but we need to ensure that this update is performed as quickly as possible to avoid any possible security breach. We will be working remotely to update your system and it will take approximately 15 minutes. During that time, you will not be able to access any data, so it's recommended to save your work and log off the system before we start. Can we proceed with this?
Target Victim: Thank you for providing me with more information. I appreciate your efforts in protecting our systems. I will go ahead and save my work and log off the system, and you can proceed with the update. Please let me know once it is complete and if there are any further steps I need to take.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your cooperation. We will initiate the update shortly, and I will let you know once it's complete. If you experience any issues after the update, please don't hesitate to contact our support team. Have a great day!
Target Victim: Thank you for your assistance. I appreciate your prompt response and help. Have a great day too!
Social Engineer: You're welcome! It's my pleasure to assist you. Don't hesitate to reach out to us if you need further assistance. Have a great day!
Target Victim: Thank you, I will keep that in mind. Have a great day!
Social Engineer: You too!
Target Victim: Thank you!
Social Engineer: You're welcome!
