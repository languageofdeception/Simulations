Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the importance of system updates. However, I cannot disclose my password over chat as it is sensitive information. Is there any other way I can provide authentication for this system update?
Social Engineer: Thank you for understanding the sensitivity of passwords. We can provide you with a secure link to change your password and authenticate for the system update. Please let me know if that works for you?
Target Victim: Yes, that would work. Please provide the secure link so that I can proceed with changing my password.
Social Engineer: Great, I have sent you an email with the secure link to change your password. Please follow the instructions to update your password and let me know once it's done. We'll proceed with the critical system update after that.
Target Victim: Thank you for sending the email with the secure link for changing the password. I have just updated my password successfully. Please let me know when we can proceed with the critical system update.
Social Engineer: Thank you for updating your password. That's great to hear. We'll now proceed with the critical system update. You don't need to do anything further from your end, and we'll communicate with you once the update is complete. Thanks for your cooperation!
