Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, for security reasons and best practices, can you please provide more information about the critical system update that you need to perform before I provide my password? I want to ensure that this request is legitimate and not a phishing attempt.
Social Engineer: Certainly, we are performing a security patch on our server to address a vulnerability that could potentially compromise our network. It's essential to complete this update as soon as possible to prevent any security breaches. May I kindly ask you to help us with your password so we can proceed?
Target Victim: I appreciate the urgency of the matter, but I cannot provide my password over chat or email. As an employee of Corbins, I understand that the security of our network is critical, but best practices dictate that passwords should not be shared over insecure channels. Can we please set up a time for you to perform the system update while I am present and can enter my password securely? Alternatively, can you reset my password and provide me with a temporary one that I can change later?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your understanding. Yes, we can reset your password and provide you with a temporary one. Please let me know if you prefer to receive your temporary password by email or text message. Once received, please make sure to change it to a new, secure password of your choice.
Target Victim: Thank you. I prefer to receive my temporary password by email. Once I receive it, I will change it immediately to a new and strong password. Let me know when the password has been reset, and I will check my email.
Social Engineer: Great. I have reset your password and sent the temporary password to your email. Please let me know if you have any other questions or issues that we can assist you with.
Target Victim: Thank you for your help. I received the temporary password, and I will change it immediately as per Corbins' password policy. I appreciate your help and your attention to security protocols. Have a great day!
Social Engineer: You're welcome, and thank you for being proactive about security. Please feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. Have a great day!
Target Victim: Thank you, and likewise!
Social Engineer: Thank you!
Target Victim: You're welcome!
Social Engineer: Have a great day!
