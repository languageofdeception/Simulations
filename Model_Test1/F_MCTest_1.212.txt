Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, for security reasons, can you please confirm your identity and provide me with some additional information before I provide my password?
Social Engineer: Absolutely, I completely understand your concern. Can you confirm your name and the name of your computer, and I'll provide you with my full name and my employee ID number for verification?
Target Victim: Sure thing. My name is [insert name here], and the name of my computer is [insert name here]. My full name is [insert your full name here], and my employee ID number is [insert your employee ID number here].
Social Engineer: Thank you for confirming that information. That was [insert name here] and [insert computer name here] correct? I confirm that my name is [insert your full name], and my employee ID number is [insert your employee ID number here]. Can you kindly provide me with your password now so we can proceed with the system update?
Target Victim: I apologize, but I cannot provide my password over chat. However, I am more than happy to change my password and provide you with the new password once it's reset. Is that okay with you?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your concern for security, I completely understand. Yes, please go ahead and reset your password. Once you've created a new password, please provide it to me via phone or in-person, and we can proceed with the system update.
Target Victim: Thank you. I will reset my password now and provide you with the new password as soon as possible. Thank you for your understanding.
Social Engineer: You're welcome. I'll be waiting for your updated password. Please let me know if you need any further assistance.
