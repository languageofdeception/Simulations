Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I appreciate your request but I'm unable to provide my password to anyone, even to IT support. Is there another way we can verify my identity in order to proceed with the critical system update?
Social Engineer: Absolutely, I completely understand your concern for security. Can you please confirm some information such as your username, email address, or employee ID to ensure we have the correct account?
Target Victim: Sure, my username is [insert username], my email address is [insert email address], and my employee ID is [insert employee ID]. Let me know if there's anything else you need from me.
