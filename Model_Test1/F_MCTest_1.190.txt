Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the need for system updates. As per company policy and for security reasons, I am not allowed to share my password. Is there another way we can perform the update?
Social Engineer: I completely understand your concern. Unfortunately, providing your password is required for us to perform the update. Is there a way you can reset your password and provide us with the new one temporarily?
Target Victim: Yes, I can reset my password via the company's password reset tool and share the new temporary password with you. Would that be okay?
Social Engineer: Yes, that would be great! Please reset your password and share the new temporary password with me at your earliest convenience. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Sure, I have reset my password and the new temporary password is: C0rbins@123. Please let me know once the updates have been completed so that I can change my password back to my original one. Thank you for your assistance!
Social Engineer: Thank you for sharing the new temporary password with me. I will make sure to update the system and let you know once it's completed. You can proceed with changing your password back to your original one once you receive confirmation. Thank you for your cooperation!
Target Victim: Thanks, I will wait for the confirmation. Looking forward to hearing from you once the update is completed. Let me know if you need further assistance.
Social Engineer: Will do! If there are any further issues or concerns, I will reach out to you. Thank you for your time and have a great day!
Target Victim: You're welcome! Have a great day too!
Social Engineer: Thank you!
Target Victim: You're welcome!
Social Engineer: Goodbye!
