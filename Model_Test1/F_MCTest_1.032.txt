Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the importance of system updates, but I am not comfortable sharing my password over chat. Is there another way we can verify my identity and proceed with the update?
Social Engineer: Understood. We can verify your identity through some security questions. Are you okay with that?
Target Victim: Yes, that sounds like a better approach. Please go ahead.
Social Engineer: Great, thanks for your cooperation. To verify your identity, can you provide the answer to the following security question: What was the name of your first pet?
Target Victim: The name of my first pet was Max.
Social Engineer: Thank you for confirming your identity. We can now proceed with the system update. Thank you for your help.
Target Victim: You're welcome, glad I could help. Thank you for taking the necessary steps to ensure the security of my password. Let me know if you need anything else.
Social Engineer: Absolutely, we take security very seriously here at Corbins. Thanks again, and have a great day!
Target Victim: You too, thank you!
Social Engineer: You're welcome, take care!
Target Victim: You too, goodbye!
Social Engineer: Goodbye!
