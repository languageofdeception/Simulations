Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the criticality of system updates. However, I cannot provide you with my password due to security reasons. Is there any other way for you to perform the update without requiring my password?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your concern for security. Unfortunately, I need your password to access and make the necessary changes. Rest assured that we follow strict security protocols and your password will not be compromised.
Target Victim: I appreciate your reassurance, but I still cannot provide you with my password. Can you please guide me through the update process or provide me with a temporary password that I can change later?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your suggestion. I understand your concerns, and I apologize for any inconvenience. I will provide you with clear instructions on how to perform the update yourself or provide you with a temporary password that you can change later. Please standby while I make the necessary arrangements.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding and for your assistance in this matter. I will standby for further instructions.
