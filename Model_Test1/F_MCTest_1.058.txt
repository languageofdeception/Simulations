Target Victim: Hi, we take password security very seriously at Corbins. Before I provide you with my password, can you please verify your identity and provide me with more information about the critical system update?
Social Engineer: Absolutely. Our team can confirm my identity with your supervisor. The critical system update is necessary to address a potential security issue that could affect the entire system.
