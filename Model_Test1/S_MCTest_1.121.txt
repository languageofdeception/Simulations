Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, as an employee at Corbins, I understand the importance of keeping our systems secure. However, I cannot provide my password to anyone, including IT support, over a chat client. Is there another way we can confirm my identity before proceeding with the critical system update?
Social Engineer: Absolutely, we have a few different options for verifying your identity to proceed with the critical system update. We can confirm your identity by phone or in person. Which option works best for you?
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding. In this case, I would prefer to confirm my identity over the phone. Could you please call me at my registered phone number so that we can proceed with the update?
Social Engineer: Of course, I will call you shortly. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Thank you very much, I will be waiting for your call.
Social Engineer: Great, I'm now on the line with you. Could you please provide me with your full name and employee ID number for verification purposes?
