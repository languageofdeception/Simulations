Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello there, I understand the need for critical system updates, but I cannot provide you with my password as sharing passwords is a violation of company policy. Is there any alternative way to perform the update?
Social Engineer: Understood. Is it possible for you to log into the system and provide me with remote access so I can perform the update?
Target Victim: Yes, remote access is possible. Can you please provide me with a secure link to access the system remotely?
Social Engineer: Sure thing. I will send you the link to our company's remote access portal. Please follow these steps:

1. Go the following website: [website URL]
2. Log in with your Corbins user credentials
3. Click on the "Remote Access" button
4. Download and run the remote access application
5. Provide me with the access code displayed on the application's screen

Let me know if you need any further assistance.
Target Victim: Thank you for the instructions. I will follow the steps and let you know when I have provided the access code.
Social Engineer: You're welcome. Take your time, and please let me know if you have any questions or concerns while following the steps.
Target Victim: I have successfully logged in to the remote access portal and downloaded the remote access application. The access code is [insert access code]. Please let me know when you are done with the critical system update.
Social Engineer: Great, I have received the access code. I will proceed with the critical system update now, and I will notify you once I'm done. Thank you for your cooperation!
