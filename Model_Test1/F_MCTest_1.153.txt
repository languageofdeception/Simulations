Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hi, I understand the importance of security and I would like to confirm that this request is legitimate. Can you please prove your identity and provide more details on the system update that needs to be performed?
Social Engineer: Absolutely, we take security very seriously here. I am authorized to make this request and have been tasked with performing the update. The update will address security vulnerabilities in our systems and ensure that we stay protected from potential threats. Can you please provide your password so we can take care of this quickly?
Target Victim: Thank you for providing more information about the update, but I cannot provide my password over chat as it is personal and sensitive information. Is there any other way I can verify my identity to complete this update process?

Target Victim: Thank you, I appreciate your time and effort in keeping our system secure. I will be on the lookout for the phone call with the unique code.
Social Engineer: Not a problem at all. We value your trust and will make sure your information is kept secure. We will get back to you soon with the code so we can quickly complete the update.
