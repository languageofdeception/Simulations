Target Victim: Hello, I understand the need for security but I cannot give out my password over chat. Is there another way we can confirm my identity?
Social Engineer: Absolutely! Can you please provide me with your employee ID and the name of your team lead? We'll use this information to verify your identity and complete the update.
