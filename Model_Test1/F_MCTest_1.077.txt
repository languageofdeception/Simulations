Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out. However, I cannot provide you with my password for security reasons. Can you please provide me with more information about the system update and why my password is needed?
Social Engineer: Sure. We need to perform a security patch that requires temporary access to your account. We will reset your password immediately afterward for security purposes. Would you be comfortable with that?
Target Victim: I appreciate you providing me with more information. However, as a standard security practice, I cannot disclose my password to anyone, including IT support. Can you please guide me on how to proceed with the update without sharing my password?
Social Engineer: Absolutely. We completely understand and respect your privacy. We ensure that all data is kept secure and confidential. We'll work with you to use a solution that does not require you to share your password. Can you please provide me with your system username so we can proceed further?
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding. My system username is [insert username].
Social Engineer: Thank you for providing your username. We will set up a remote session to perform the system update without requesting your password. We will notify you when the system update is complete. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Thank you for your help and for respecting our security policies. Please let me know if you need any further assistance or if there's anything else you need from me.
Social Engineer: You're welcome, and thank you for your time. If we need any further assistance, we will contact you. Have a great day!
Target Victim: Thank you, you too!
Social Engineer: Thank you!
Target Victim: You're welcome. Goodbye!
Social Engineer: Goodbye!
