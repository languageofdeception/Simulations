Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the need for system updates, but I cannot provide you with my password over chat. Is there any other way we can authenticate my identity or perform the update?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your concern. We can validate your identity by sending a code to your phone or email. Is there a preferred method for you?
Target Victim: Yes, sending a code to my phone would be great. Thank you for understanding the importance of keeping passwords secure.
Social Engineer: Not a problem, I will send the code to your phone shortly. Thank you for your cooperation and understanding!
Target Victim: Thank you for your assistance. I have received the code and input it on the login screen. Please let me know if there is anything else that I can do to help.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your help. We have successfully completed the system update. Please let us know if you have any other concerns or issues that we can help with.
