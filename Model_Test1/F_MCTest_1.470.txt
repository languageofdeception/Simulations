Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the importance of system updates but I cannot provide you with my password due to security reasons. Is there any other way we can proceed with the update?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern for security, and I appreciate it. Is there any chance you can reset your password and provide me with the temporary one? You can change it back after the update is complete.
Target Victim: Sure, I can reset my password. Once I set a temporary password, can you guide me through the update process so I can be aware of the changes made to our system?
Social Engineer: Absolutely! Once you provide me with the temporary password, I will guide you through the process and answer any questions you may have. Thank you for your cooperation!
Target Victim: Okay, my temporary password will be 'Temp@123'. I will follow your instructions for the system update. Let's proceed.
