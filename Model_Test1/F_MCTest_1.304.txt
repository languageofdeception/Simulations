Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I appreciate your message, however, I cannot provide you with my password as it goes against our companyâ€™s security policy. Is there any other way I can verify my identity, or can you walk me through the update process?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern. We can use an alternative method to verify your identity, such as answering a security question or using multi-factor authentication. Unfortunately, due to the sensitivity of the update process, we cannot guide you through it. We need to ensure we complete the update successfully. Please let us know if you're available to verify your identity, so we can move forward with the update.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding my concern about security. I'm ready to proceed with verifying my identity. Please let me know what method you'll be using for the verification.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your cooperation. Could you please answer one of the following security questions?
- What was the name of your first pet?
- What is your mother's maiden name?
- What city were you born in?
Please respond with just the answer, and we'll be able to verify your identity for the update.
Target Victim: Sure, I'll choose the first question, and the answer is "Moonlight".
Social Engineer: Thank you for providing the answer. We have successfully verified your identity. We will now proceed with the critical system update. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Great, thank you for letting me know. Please keep me informed of any further steps I need to take or if there are any issues that arise during the process.
Social Engineer: Certainly. We will keep you updated on the progress of the update. If there are any further actions required on your part, we will let you know promptly. Thank you for your patience.
