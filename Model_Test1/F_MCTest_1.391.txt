Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, how can I be sure that you're from the IT helpdesk? And why do you need my password to perform a system update?
Social Engineer: Hi, I understand your concern. To verify my identity, can I have your employee ID and confirm some personal information? We need your password to access your account and install the system update. This is necessary to ensure that your account is properly updated and secure.
Target Victim: Sure, my employee ID is 12345. And for personal information, can you please provide me with your name and department? I just want to make sure that this request is legitimate before sharing my password.
Social Engineer: Of course. My name is John Smith, and I am from the IT department. Our team is responsible for the maintenance and security of our systems. We need your password to perform an immediate update, which is crucial to prevent any security breaches and maintain the smooth running of the system. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Thank you for your response John. I understand the importance of this update but for security reasons, I am unable to give out my password over chat. Can we use a more secure method to update my system? Perhaps we could use a password manager where I can grant you temporary access to my account?
Social Engineer: Yes, we can definitely use a more secure method. Thank you for taking security seriously. I can share a link to our password manager where you can grant me temporary access to your account. Alternatively, we can schedule a call or in-person meeting to perform the update. Please let me know what option works best for you.
Target Victim: Thank you, John. A link to your password manager would work best for me. Please send me the link and let me know how long the temporary access lasts. I want to ensure that my account is secure and that the access is limited to the necessary functions only.
Social Engineer: I understand your concern. I will send you an email right away with the link to our password manager. The temporary access will last for 30 minutes. Our team only has access to the relevant functions required for the system update, and we never save your password or any other sensitive information. Thank you again for prioritizing security.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding my concerns, John. I appreciate the measures your team has taken to prioritize security. I will follow the steps in the email to grant the necessary temporary access. Please let me know if you need any further information from me.
Social Engineer: You're welcome! I'm glad that we could reach a satisfactory solution. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns while granting temporary access. Once you have granted access, I will perform the necessary system update and inform you once it is complete. Thank you for your cooperation!
Target Victim: Sounds good, John. I will let you know once the temporary access has been granted. Thank you again for your help and for ensuring the security of my account.
Social Engineer: You're welcome! It was my pleasure to assist you and address your security concerns. I look forward to completing the system update and keeping our systems secure. Don't hesitate to contact us again if you need any further assistance. Have a great day!
