Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I am happy to assist with the system update. However, I cannot disclose my password over chat as it is a violation of company security policies. Is there an alternative way to verify my identity so we can proceed with the update?
Social Engineer: Yes, of course. Can you please provide me with your employee ID number or any other identifying information? We can use that information to verify your identity and proceed with the update securely.
Target Victim: Sure, my employee ID number is 12345. Is there anything else you need from me to proceed with the update?
