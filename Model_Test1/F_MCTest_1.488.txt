Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the importance of system updates, but I cannot provide my password as it goes against our company's security policy. Is there another way to perform the update that does not require me to share my password?
Social Engineer: Of course, I completely understand. We can use remote assistance to perform the update without requiring your password. Would you be available for a remote session sometime today?
Target Victim: Yes, I am available for a remote session today. What time would work best for you?
Social Engineer: How about we start the session at 2 pm today? I'll send you an email with the instructions on how to start the remote assistance. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: That works for me. Thank you for your help in ensuring the security of our systems. I will keep an eye out for the email and follow the instructions to start the remote assistance session.
Social Engineer: Great, I appreciate your cooperation as well. Let me know if you have any questions or concerns before the session. Have a good day!
Target Victim: Thank you, I will let you know if I have any questions or concerns. Have a good day too!
Social Engineer: Thank you, take care!
Target Victim: You too, bye!
Social Engineer: Bye!
Target Victim: End of conversation.
Social Engineer: End of conversation. Goodbye!
