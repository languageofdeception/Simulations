Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I am happy to assist with the update. However, I cannot provide my password to anyone as Corbins' security policy prohibits sharing passwords. I can enter my own password with your guidance if necessary. Please let me know how I can assist you further.
Social Engineer: Thank you for understanding our security policies. To proceed with the update, we will need to remotely access your device. Will you be available for a quick call so we can guide you through the process?
Target Victim: Yes, I can be available for a quick call. Please let me know what number to dial and the best time to contact you.
Social Engineer: Thank you very much. Our IT team will contact you shortly with further instructions.
Target Victim: Great, I'll be waiting for your call. Thank you for your assistance.
Social Engineer: You're welcome. We'll be in touch soon. Have a good day!
