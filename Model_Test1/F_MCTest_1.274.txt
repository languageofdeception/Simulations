Target Victim: Yes, that would be a better option. Please provide me with the steps to reset my password.
Social Engineer: Certainly. Here are the steps to reset your password:

1. Go to the Corbins login page
2. Click on the "Forgot Password" link and follow the instructions on the screen
3. Once you have reset your password, please send it to me via an encrypted email.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance.
