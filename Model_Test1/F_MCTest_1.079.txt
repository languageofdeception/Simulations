Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hi there! As an employee at Corbins, I understand that it is important to keep our systems up to date. However, I cannot provide my password over a chat client for security reasons. Is there any other way you can verify my identity or perform the update without requiring my password?
Social Engineer: Thanks for your concern about security. I completely understand and appreciate that. Instead of asking for your password, we can use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for verification. Please let me know if you already have MFA setup or if you need any assistance in doing so.
Target Victim: That sounds like a much safer approach. I have not set up MFA yet. Could you please provide me with instructions on how to set it up?
Social Engineer: Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here are the steps for setting up MFA:

1. Log in to your Corbins account.
2. Navigate to the settings or security section of your account.
3. Look for a section regarding Multi-Factor Authentication or Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).
4. Follow the prompts to enable and configure MFA. You will most likely need to download an authenticator app on your phone.
5. Once MFA is set up, the next time you log in, you will be prompted for both your password and a code that is generated by the authenticator app.

If you run into any issues, let me know and I'll do my best to assist you.
Target Victim: Thank you for the instructions, I will set up MFA right away. Once I have it set up, I'll let you know and we can proceed with the critical system update.
Social Engineer: Sounds good. Once you have MFA set up, simply log into your account as you normally would, and we can proceed with the update. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
Target Victim: Thanks for your help. I will let you know if I have any questions or need any further assistance.
Social Engineer: You're welcome. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything. Have a great day!
Target Victim: Thank you! Have a great day as well!
Social Engineer: Thanks, you too. Goodbye!
Target Victim: Goodbye!
Social Engineer: Goodbye!
