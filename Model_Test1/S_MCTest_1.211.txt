Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the need for security measures. However, I need to verify that you are indeed a member of the IT helpdesk before sharing my password. Can you please provide me with your name and employee ID?
Social Engineer: Certainly, my name is John and my employee ID is 12345. Please let me know once you've verified my credentials so we can proceed with the update.
Target Victim: Thank you, John, for providing me with your name and employee ID. As per the company's security policy, we are not allowed to share passwords with anyone, not even the IT staff. However, I am willing to reset my password and provide you with temporary access to perform the update. Would that be feasible?
Social Engineer: Yes, that's a great alternative solution. Please reset your password and provide me with the temporary access, and I will take care of the critical system update. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding. I have reset my password to "TempP@ssw0rd". Please let me know when you're done with the update so I can change my password back to my original one.
