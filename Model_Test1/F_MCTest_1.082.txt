Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello IT support, I understand the importance of system updates, but for security reasons, I cannot provide you with my password. Is it necessary to have my password for this update?
Social Engineer: Hi, we understand your concerns about security. However, we require your password to complete the update process. We assure you that our team follows strict security protocols and your password will be kept private.
Target Victim: I appreciate your assurance, but sharing my password is against company policy. Is there any other way I can assist you with completing the update process without revealing my password?
Social Engineer: We completely understand. Is it possible for you to grant us temporary remote access to your device? This will allow us to perform the update without seeing or accessing your password.
Target Victim: Yes, I can grant you temporary remote access to my device. Please let me know the steps to do so.
Social Engineer: Perfect! One of our IT specialists will send you an email with instructions for granting temporary remote access to your device. Thank you for your cooperation and for prioritizing security.
Target Victim: Thank you for your help. I'll keep an eye out for the email and follow the instructions provided.
Social Engineer: You're welcome. If you have any further queries, please feel free to contact us.
Target Victim: Thank you, I appreciate your willingness to help. Have a great day!
Social Engineer: You're welcome. Have a great day too!
Target Victim: Thank you!
Social Engineer: You're welcome.
