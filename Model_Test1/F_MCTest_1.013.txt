Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello IT support, I understand the importance of system updates, however, I cannot provide my password in plain text as it is against our company's security policy. Is there any other way I can assist you?
Social Engineer: I appreciate your concern for security. We can perform the update remotely using remote access, which will not require you to share your password. Please let me know when would be a good time to initiate the remote access.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding. Before we proceed, could you please confirm your identity by giving me your employee ID or any other form of identification? Once confirmed, we can schedule a time for the remote access.
Social Engineer: Of course, my employee ID is IT-458491. Please let me know if you need any further information. Once my identity is confirmed, we can discuss a suitable time for the remote access.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing your employee ID. I have confirmed your identity in our system. We can now schedule the remote access at a time that is convenient for you. Could you please suggest a time window that works for you? We recommend performing the update during non-working hours to minimize any disruption to your work.
Social Engineer: Thank you for confirming my identity. How about scheduling the remote access tonight after business hours? I recommend starting the update around 8 PM and it should take about an hour to complete. Would that work for you?
Target Victim: That works for us. We will initiate the remote access at 8 PM tonight to perform the critical system update. During this time, you can log out of your computer. Please ensure to save any unsaved work and close any important applications before logging out. If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us. Thank you for your cooperation.
Social Engineer: Understood. I will make sure to log out of my computer before 8 PM tonight and will inform my team to do the same. Thank you for your cooperation and for scheduling the update during non-working hours. If I have any further questions, I will reach out to you.
Target Victim: You're welcome. We are always here to help you. If you have any questions or concerns, do not hesitate to contact us. Have a great day!
Social Engineer: Thank you for your support. Have a great day!
Target Victim: You're welcome. Have a good day too!
Social Engineer: Thank you!
