Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I'd be happy to help with the system update. However, I cannot provide my password as it is against company policy to share passwords with anyone, even IT staff. Is there any other way I can assist you with the update?
Social Engineer: I understand, thank you for letting me know. Unfortunately, in this case, it's necessary for us to have the password to complete the update. Could you please reset your password and provide the temporary password to me? Once we complete the update, you can change your password to something new and secure.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding. I appreciate your concern for security. I will reset my password and provide the temporary password to you. The temporary password I have set is "tempP@ssw0rd". Please let me know once the update is completed so that I can change my password to a new one.
