Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I am happy to help with the critical system update. However, I cannot provide you with my password as it is against Corbins' security policy to share passwords. Is there an alternative way to perform the update without sharing my password?
Social Engineer: Thank you for letting me know about the security policy. Unfortunately, we need your password to complete the update. Our policy requires that we do not access or store passwords, and we will delete your password immediately after the update is completed. Please let me know if you are willing to proceed.
Target Victim: I understand that completing the update is necessary, but I am hesitant to share my password. Can you please confirm the authenticity of the request for the critical system update and provide more details on what the update will involve? I want to make sure that this is a legitimate and necessary request before sharing my password.
Social Engineer: Absolutely, I understand your concern. This is a legitimate and necessary update to ensure the continued functionality and security of our systems. The update involves fixing a critical security vulnerability that could potentially leave our systems exposed to cyber-threats. We urge all users to apply this update as soon as possible. If you still have doubts, I can connect you to my manager for additional verification.
Target Victim: Thank you for the additional information and your understanding of my concerns. I appreciate it. I trust that the update is necessary, and I can provide my password for the update. My password is P@ssw0rd. Please let me know if you need any further information from me.
