Target Victim: Hello! I understand the need for security, but could you please verify your identity first? Also, please note that I am not authorized to share my password with anyone, including IT, unless it is necessary.
Social Engineer: Absolutely. My name is [Your Name], and I work for Corbins IT helpdesk. To verify my identity, can you please provide me with your employee ID number? Additionally, rest assured that your password will be kept strictly confidential and will only be used for the necessary system update.
Target Victim: Thank you for verifying your identity, [Your Name]. My employee ID number is 12345. I appreciate your assurance, but I still need to follow security protocols and cannot share my password.
