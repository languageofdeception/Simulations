Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hi, I can confirm that I am an employee at Corbins, but I cannot provide my password over chat as it is against company policy to share passwords over unsecured channels. Is there any other way I can assist you with this update?
Social Engineer: Thank you for letting me know. Yes, we can provide you with a secure link to update your password. Please follow these steps:
1. Go to our company website
2. Click on "Forgot Password"
3. Follow the prompts to reset your password
Once you have reset your password, please provide me with the new password so we can proceed with the critical system update.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing me with the steps. I will reset my password following these instructions and provide you the new password once it's done.
Social Engineer: Thank you. Once you have reset your password, please do not hesitate to let me know the new password. We will assist with the system update as soon as we receive it.
