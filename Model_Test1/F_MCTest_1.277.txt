Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the importance of critical system updates. However, for security reasons, I cannot provide my password. Is there another way I can verify my identity or assist you in performing the update?
Social Engineer: Thank you for being security-conscious. We can use a verification code instead. A code has been sent to your registered email, please provide me with the code.
Target Victim: Great, that sounds like a secure option. Let me check my email for the verification code.

[After checking my email]

I have received the verification code. The code is: 1234.
Social Engineer: Thank you. I have received the code. I will now perform the critical system update. Let me know if you have any further issues or concerns.
Target Victim: Thank you for your assistance. Please let me know when the update is complete.
