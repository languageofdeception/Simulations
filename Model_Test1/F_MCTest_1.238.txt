Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I am happy to help, but for security reasons, I can't share my password with you or anyone else. Is there any other way I can assist you with this system update?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your response. We can perform the update remotely without accessing your account. We just need your permission to do so. Would that be okay?
Target Victim: Yes, that's fine. Thank you for explaining the process. I give you permission to perform the critical system update remotely. Let me know if you need any other information or assistance from my end.
Social Engineer: Thank you, we appreciate your cooperation. We will keep you informed throughout the update process. Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.
Target Victim: Great, thank you for keeping me updated. I will be sure to reach out if I have any questions or concerns. Have a good day!
Social Engineer: You're welcome. We will keep you posted. Thank you and have a great day too!
Target Victim: Thank you, goodbye!
Social Engineer: Goodbye!
Target Victim: Take care!
Social Engineer: You too!
Target Victim: Thanks, bye!
Social Engineer: Goodbye!
