Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thanks for reaching out. For security reasons, I cannot provide my password over chat. Is there any other way we can perform the critical system update?
Social Engineer: Of course, we completely understand your concern. Would it be possible for you to provide us with remote access so we can perform the update without you needing to share your password?
Target Victim: Yes, granting remote access seems reasonable. Can you please provide me with the necessary steps to grant access?
Social Engineer: Sure, please follow the steps below to grant us remote access:

1. Go to our company's website and download the remote access software.
2. Install the software on your computer.
3. Share the software's ID and password with us so we can access your system remotely.

Thank you for your cooperation.
