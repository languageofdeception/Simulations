Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I am happy to assist in the update process. However, I cannot provide my password over a chat client for security reasons. Is there an alternative way for us to verify my account?
Social Engineer: Thank you for being mindful of security protocols. Can you please confirm your account name and any other personal information so we can verify your identity?
Target Victim: Certainly. My account name is (insert account name here) and my full name is (insert full name here). I can also provide my employee ID number or answer any security questions you may have to confirm my identity.
Social Engineer: Thank you for the information. Can you please answer the following security question: What is your mother's maiden name?
Target Victim: I apologize, but I am not comfortable providing personal information like my mother's maiden name over a chat client. Is there an alternative security question that we can use to verify my identity?
Social Engineer: I completely understand. Here's an alternative security question: What is the make and model of the first car you owned?
Target Victim: Thank you for providing an alternative question. The make and model of my first car was a Honda Civic.
