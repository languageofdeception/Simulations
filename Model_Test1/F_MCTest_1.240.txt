Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out. As an employee, I understand the importance of system updates, but I'm hesitant to provide my password over chat for security reasons. Is there a different way we can verify my credentials?
Social Engineer: Absolutely, I completely understand your concerns. Can you please verify your identity by providing your username and answering a security question?
Target Victim: Sure, my username is [insert username] and I'm happy to answer any security questions you may have.
Social Engineer: Great, thank you. For security purposes, can you please provide your answer to the security question "What was the name of your first pet?"
