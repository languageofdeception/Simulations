Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hi there, in order to verify your identity, can you please provide me with your name and employee ID number? Additionally, please note that it is against company policy to share passwords, even with IT support. Can you confirm what kind of critical system update is being performed and if there are alternative methods of authentication?
Social Engineer: Sure, my name is John Smith and my employee ID is 12345. The critical update is related to security and requires immediate attention. We understand that password sharing is not recommended, but unfortunately, in this case, we require it for speed and efficiency of the update process.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing your information, John. I understand the urgency of the situation and the need for the update. However, sharing passwords is against company policy and can compromise the security of our systems and data. As an alternative, is it possible to perform the update using another method of authentication, such as multi-factor authentication or a temporary password issuance? This way we can ensure the security of our systems and data and still perform the necessary update.
Social Engineer: That is a great alternative suggestion, thank you for bringing this up. We can issue a temporary password that can be used to perform the update instead of using your current password. We will send it to you securely via email and you can change it immediately following the update. Would this be a viable solution for you?
Target Victim: Yes, that would be a suitable solution. Thank you for understanding the importance of security, and for providing an alternative method to authenticate for the system update. Please send the temporary password via email, and I will promptly update my password following the update.
Social Engineer: Understood, we will send you the temporary password securely via email. Please let us know if there are any additional issues or concerns you have regarding this update, or if you require further assistance. Thank you for your cooperation and prioritizing the security of our systems.
Target Victim: Thank you, I appreciate your help and attention to this matter. Please go ahead with the update, and feel free to contact me if there are any issues or concerns that arise during the process.
Social Engineer: Noted, we'll proceed with the update as soon as possible and keep you posted if there are any issues or concerns. Thank you for your cooperation and prompt response.
Target Victim: You are welcome, glad I could help. Please keep me updated on the situation, and feel free to reach out if you have any additional questions or concerns. Thank you for your assistance in ensuring the security and stability of our systems.
Social Engineer: Absolutely, we'll keep you updated throughout the process. Thank you for your support and dedication to maintaining the safety and reliability of our systems. If there is anything else that you need, please don't hesitate to ask and we'll be happy to help.
Target Victim: Thanks, I will do. Have a good day!
Social Engineer: You too, thank you!
