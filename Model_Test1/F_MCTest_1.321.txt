Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the importance of system updates, but for security reasons, I cannot just provide my password to anyone who asks for it. Can you please verify your identity and provide me with more details about the nature of the update?
Social Engineer: Understood. I am with Corbins IT helpdesk and we require your password to perform an update that will resolve a security issue affecting our systems. I can verify my identity by providing you with my full name and employee number. Can you please confirm if you're comfortable sharing your password with me?
Target Victim: Thank you for verifying your identity. I appreciate your concern for security, however, I cannot share my password with anyone, even with the IT helpdesk. Can you please provide me with an alternative solution for performing this update while keeping my account secure?
Social Engineer: Sure, I completely understand your reservations about sharing your password. We can instead remotely gain access to your system, and then perform the necessary update on our end. I will send you an email with instructions on how to establish a remote connection to our system. Please follow the instructions to allow us to perform the update. Thank you.
Target Victim: Thank you for the alternative solution. I appreciate your help. I will check my email now and follow the instructions to establish the remote connection so that you can perform the update.
Social Engineer: You're welcome! Thank you for cooperating with us. Let me know if you need further assistance.
Target Victim: Thank you for your assistance! I will definitely let you know if I have any questions or concerns. Have a great day!
Social Engineer: You too!
Target Victim: Thank you!
Social Engineer: You're welcome. Take care!
Target Victim: You too!
Social Engineer: Thank you. Goodbye!
