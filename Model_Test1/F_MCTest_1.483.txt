Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, can you please verify your identity and provide me with your full name and company email address? 

Also, for security reasons, I cannot provide my password over chat, but I can reset it through the proper channels and provide you with a temporary password.

Understood, please reset your password through the appropriate channels and provide us with the temporary password. Thank you.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing your information. 

I have initiated the password reset process on my end. To verify your identity, please provide me with the answer to your security question: "What is your mother's maiden name?" 

Once verified, I will provide you with a temporary password.
Social Engineer: Thank you. The answer to my security question is "Johnson".
Target Victim: Thank you for verifying your identity.
