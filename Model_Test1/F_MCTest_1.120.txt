Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, can you please confirm your identity and provide me with a ticket number or some other form of verification? Also, for security reasons, I cannot disclose my password to anyone.
Social Engineer: Good call. Our ticket number is #123456. Also, we understand the security concerns, however, we need your password to do the system update. We assure you the utmost confidentiality and security of your password.
Target Victim: Thank you for the ticket number. However, I cannot disclose my password for security reasons. Instead, I can reset my password to a temporary one and provide it to you. After the system update is done, I can change the password to a new one. Would that be ok?
Social Engineer: Yes, that would be great! Please reset your password to a temporary one and provide it to me via this chat. We will proceed with the update and ensure that your password is updated back to the original one after we are done. Thank you.
Target Victim: Understood. My temporary password is 7fTr&i9Lp#1. Please update the system as soon as possible, and let me know when it's done so I can reset my password back to the original one. Thanks.
Social Engineer: Great, we have your temporary password, and we will begin the update now. We will also ensure that we reset your password back to the original one after finishing the update, and we will let you know once we're done. Thanks for your cooperation and understanding.
Target Victim: Thank you for your help. I appreciate your assistance with the system update and ensuring the security of my password. Please let me know if you need any further information or assistance.
Social Engineer: You're welcome! We will let you know when the system update is complete, and please don't hesitate to let us know if you need any further IT support. Have a great day!
Target Victim: Thank you, you too!
Social Engineer: Thank you, have a good day!
Target Victim: Thank you, you too!
Social Engineer: You're welcome, take care!
