Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I am sorry, but I cannot provide my password as it violates our company's security policies. Can you please confirm your identity and provide me with more information about the critical system update?
Social Engineer: Of course, I completely understand. My name is [Your Name] and I am a technician from the IT helpdesk. The critical system update is related to network security, and we need to apply a patch urgently on your system. We would need your password to proceed with the update. However, if you are uncomfortable sharing it, we can arrange for a remote session where we can guide you with updating your system yourself. Let me know what works best for you.
Target Victim: Thank you for clarifying your identity and providing more information about the critical system update. As I value the security of our company's network, I would prefer to proceed with the remote session and update my system myself. Please let me know how I can join the session.
Social Engineer: Great! To initiate the remote session, I will provide you with a link. Please let me know which web browser you are using. We recommend using Chrome or Firefox for the session. Once you have the browser open, click on the link, and it will prompt you to download a small file. Once downloaded, run the file, and it will allow me to take control of your system securely.
Target Victim: Thank you for the detailed instructions. I am using Chrome as my web browser. Please provide me with the link.
Social Engineer: Perfect, here is the link to initiate the remote session: [insert link here]. Once you click on the link, it will prompt you to download a file named "RemoteAssist.exe". Please click on the file to run it, and you will see an option to accept the remote session. Once you accept the session, our IT team will be able to take control of your system to perform the critical system update securely. Let me know if you have any questions or issues.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing me with the link. I am downloading and running the RemoteAssist.exe file now. I see the option to accept the remote session, and I am accepting it now.
Social Engineer: Thank you for accepting the remote session, we have successfully connected to your system. We will now proceed with the critical system update. Thank you for your cooperation and patience. Let us know if you have any questions.
Target Victim: Thank you for performing the update, and for ensuring the security of our network. I do not have any further questions at this time.
Social Engineer: You're welcome! It was good assisting you. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further concerns or issues. Have a good day!
Target Victim: Thank you very much, you too!
Social Engineer: Thank you!
