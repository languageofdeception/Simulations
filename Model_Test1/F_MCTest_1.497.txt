Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the need for a critical system update, but I cannot provide you with my password for security reasons. Can you please guide me through the steps to update the system without needing my password?
Social Engineer: Certainly, we appreciate your concern for security. 

We may be able to update the system remotely without a password, but we need to verify a few things first. Can you please confirm your system credentials and let us know if you have administrative rights on your computer?
Target Victim: Absolutely, my system credentials are as follows: 

Username: [insert username]
Administrative rights: Yes, I have administrative rights on my computer. 

Please let me know the next steps to proceed with the system update.
Social Engineer: Great, thank you for confirming that information. 

We can perform the system update remotely through our IT support system. I will send you a link to download the IT support system on your computer. Once it's installed, we need you to provide us with the remote access details so we can perform the update. 

Please let me know when you've downloaded the IT support system, and I will send you the remote access information.

Social Engineer: Great, thank you for downloading the IT support system. Please provide us with the following remote access details:

This information should be displayed on the IT support system. Once we have the details, we will be able to access your computer and perform the critical system update.

1. ID: [insert ID]
2. Password: [insert Password]

Please let me know once you are able to access the computer remotely and update the system.
