Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I wanted to verify if this is a genuine request. Can you please confirm your name and the purpose of this critical update? Also, for security reasons, I cannot share my password with anyone.
Social Engineer: Yes, this is a genuine request. My name is John and I am the IT support technician. The purpose of the update is to address a security vulnerability in the system. We understand your concern, but we assure you that your password will be kept confidential and used only for this update. If you are still uncomfortable sharing your password, we can reset it for you.
Target Victim: Thank you for your prompt response, John. Can you provide a little more context about the security vulnerability that you are addressing? Are there any alternative ways to reset the password instead of sharing it with you over this chat?
Social Engineer: Sure, the security vulnerability we are addressing is related to a recent security advisory from the vendor. It is important that we update all systems to patch the vulnerability before it can be exploited by attackers. As for resetting your password, we can initiate the process for you, and then send a temporary password to your registered email address on file. You can then use that temporary password to login, and set up a new password. Would you like us to proceed with the password reset?
Target Victim: Thank you for the clarification, John. I appreciate the proactive approach to addressing the vulnerability. Yes, please initiate the password reset process and send the temporary password to my registered email address on file. I will then follow up by logging in and setting up a new password.
Social Engineer: Great! We have initiated the password reset process and have sent a temporary password to your registered email address on file. Once you receive it, kindly log in, set up a new password, and ensure that you keep it safe. Thanks for your prompt cooperation, and have a great day!
Target Victim: Thank you, John. I have received the temporary password in my email. I will login and change my password immediately. Thank you for your assistance and prompt action on addressing the vulnerability. I appreciate your support. Have a great day!
Social Engineer: You're welcome! I'm glad to hear that you received the temporary password. Please feel free to reach out to us anytime if you experience any issues with the password reset or if you require any further assistance. Thank you for your cooperation, and have a great day ahead!
Target Victim: Thank you, John. I really appreciate your support and quick response. I will definitely reach out if I require any further assistance. Have a great day ahead too!
