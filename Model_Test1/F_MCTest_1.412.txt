Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hi, I understand your request for a critical system update. However, I cannot provide you with my password as it is against company policy to disclose passwords, even to IT support. Is there another way we can perform the system update securely?
Social Engineer: Thank you for informing me about the company policy. We do have a secure way to reset the password, which involves sending a password reset link to your email. Would you like us to proceed with that?
Target Victim: Yes, that sounds like an appropriate solution to proceed with. Please send the password reset link to my email and I will follow the instructions to create a new password. Thank you for taking the necessary steps to maintain the security of our systems.
