Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand that system updates are important, but it's against company policy to provide my password to anyone, even the IT department. Is there any other way that we can proceed with the update?
Social Engineer: I completely understand your concerns. Could you please let me know if you have any remote access tool installed on your system? That way we can remotely access and update the system without requiring any password from your end.
Target Victim: Yes, we have a remote access tool installed on our system. Can you provide me with the details of how to use it?
Social Engineer: Thank you for confirming that. Can you please share the name of the remote access tool that you have installed? I will look up the details and guide you through the process.
Target Victim: We use TeamViewer for remote access.
Social Engineer: Great, TeamViewer is a commonly used remote access tool. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Open the TeamViewer application on your computer.
2. Share your ID and password with me so I can connect to your system.
3. Once connected, I will perform the necessary updates and disconnect after completion.

Please let me know if you need further assistance.
Target Victim: Thank you for the instructions. Here is my ID and password: 

ID: 123 456 789 
Password: P@ssw0rd 

Please let me know when you are connected.
