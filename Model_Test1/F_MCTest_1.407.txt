Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, can you please confirm your identity by providing me with your name and employee ID? Also, as a security precaution, I cannot disclose my password over chat. Is there any other way we can perform the update?
Social Engineer: Of course, my name is John Smith and my employee ID is 1234. As for the update, we can schedule a remote session where I can perform the update while you are present to enter your password. Would that work for you?
Target Victim: Thank you, John. That sounds like a good alternative. When would be a good time to schedule the remote session? We wouldn't want to cause any disruption to my work or other employees' work.
Social Engineer: Great! How about scheduling the remote session after work hours or during lunch break? I can work with your availability to ensure that the update is performed with minimal disruption to your work schedule. Please let me know which time works best for you.
Target Victim: Lunch break sounds good. How about scheduling the remote session at 12:30 pm tomorrow? Please confirm that you will be available at that time.
Social Engineer: 12:30 pm tomorrow works for me. I will be available and ready to perform the update. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Excellent, the remote session is scheduled for 12:30 pm tomorrow. I will send you a calendar invite to confirm the details. Thank you for prioritizing the security of our system.
Social Engineer: You're welcome! I look forward to running the update tomorrow and I appreciate your security-minded approach. Thanks for your cooperation as well.
Target Victim: No problem! I am always happy to assist and do my best to ensure the security of our systems. Have a good day!
Social Engineer: You too, have a great day!
Target Victim: Thank you!
Social Engineer: You're welcome!
