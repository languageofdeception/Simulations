Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hi, thank you for reaching out. Can you please verify your identity by providing me with your name and employee ID? Also, please note that I am not authorized to share my password with anyone as it violates our company's security policies. What kind of update are you performing?
Social Engineer: My name is John and my employee ID is 1234. The update we are performing is to address a security vulnerability that has been discovered. We understand that sharing passwords is against our policy, however, we assure you that we will keep it secure and will not use it for anything except for this specific update.
Target Victim: Hi John, thank you for verifying your identity. I appreciate your concern for security and ensuring that my password will be kept secure. However, it is still against company policy to share passwords with anyone, including members of the IT helpdesk.

Instead, can you please guide me through the steps required to reset my password? I can follow the necessary protocols and reset my password myself to ensure the security of my account and our company's data.
