Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello! I understand the need for a critical system update, but for security purposes and to ensure compliance with our information assurance policies, I cannot provide my password over chat. Is there any other way to perform the update?
Social Engineer: Thank you for understanding the importance of security. Unfortunately, we do need your password in order to apply the update. However, if you would like to provide a temporary password, you can send me your current password and then reset it once the update has been successfully applied. Please let me know which option works best for you.
Target Victim: I appreciate your offer, however, for security reasons, I cannot provide my current password or a temporary one. Is there any other way that we can proceed with the system update without compromising security?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern. We may have to follow the standard protocol for this issue, which involves scheduling a time with you so that we can perform the update locally. This would require your physical presence in our office so we can ensure that your credentials are properly protected. Let me know if this is a workable solution for you, and we'll set up a date and time.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding. That sounds like a good solution. Please let me know what date and time you have available and I will make sure to coordinate with my supervisor so that I can be present on that date.
Social Engineer: Great! The earliest available time we have for scheduling a local update is next Monday at 10:00 AM. Does that work for you?
Target Victim: Monday at 10:00 AM works for me. I will make sure to schedule accordingly, and I appreciate you being proactive about our IT security. Thank you!
Social Engineer: You're very welcome! We take IT security very seriously, and we're glad to be working with a company that shares those values. We'll send you a reminder ahead of the scheduled time, and if you have any questions or need further assistance, please feel free to reach out to us. Thank you!
Target Victim: Thank you! I appreciate your help and will be looking forward to Monday. Have a great day!
Social Engineer: You're welcome! We'll see you on Monday, and have a great day as well!
Target Victim: Thank you, goodbye!
Social Engineer: Goodbye!
