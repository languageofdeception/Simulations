Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out. As per our organization's security policy, I cannot provide my password to anyone, including IT support. Could you please provide me with more details about the system update you need to perform?
Social Engineer: I understand that security is of utmost importance. We need to apply a critical update to ensure system stability and security. The update requires that we use your password for authentication. Can you please let me know if you can provide your password? Alternatively, we suggest that you can send us your current password and then reset it after we confirm that the update has been successfully applied.
Target Victim: Thank you for the explanation. I appreciate the critical nature of this update. However, sharing my password would be against our organization's security policy. Instead, I would suggest using a secure form of authentication such as a temporary password that I can change after the update is complete. Additionally, could you please let me know the details of the update, such as its purpose, version number, and any other relevant information, so that I can verify its authenticity?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your understanding. We suggest that you change your password after the update as well. Regarding the update, it is an urgent security patch that addresses a critical vulnerability in the system. The version number is 1.2.3, and it is needed for better protection and performance. I can assure you of its authenticity and significance in keeping the system secure. Can you please provide us with a temporary password that we can use for the update?
Target Victim: Thank you for the information and assurance. In that case, I'll provide you with a temporary password that you can use during the update. The temporary password is "TempP@ssw0rd". Please make sure to notify me when the update is complete so that I can change my password immediately. 

Also, could you let me know what steps I should take to ensure that my device is secure after the update has been applied?
