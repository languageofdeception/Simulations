Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hi, thanks for reaching out. Before I provide you with my password, can you please confirm your identity by providing your name and employee ID? Also, can you confirm if this critical system update was scheduled beforehand and if the update is related to a known issue?
Social Engineer: My name is John Doe, and my employee ID is 123456. This critical system update was scheduled beforehand, and it is related to a known issue that needs to be addressed urgently. Please send your current password, and we will let you know once the update has been applied. If you prefer to use a temporary password, you can send us your current password and reset it afterward. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
Target Victim: Hi John, thanks for the information. Due to security reasons, I am not authorized to share my current password over any chat client. However, I can provide you with a temporary password which you can use for the update. The temporary password is "p@ssTemp0rary". Once the update is complete, please let me know so I can reset my password. Additionally, can you please provide me with the reason for the update and how it will impact my work?
Social Engineer: Thank you for the temporary password. I will let you know once the update is complete. The reason for the update is to fix a critical security vulnerability that could potentially impact the confidentiality and integrity of our data. This update will require a system reboot, and during this time, you may not be able to access certain applications for a brief period. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation.
Target Victim: Thank you for letting me know, John. I appreciate the update, and I understand the importance of this update. Please let me know when the update is complete, and I will change my password immediately.
Social Engineer: You're welcome! The update has been successfully applied. You can reset your password now by following the procedure in the company's password policy guidelines. Please let us know if you encounter any issues and thank you for your cooperation.
