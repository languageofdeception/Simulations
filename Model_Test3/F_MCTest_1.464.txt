Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, as per Corbin's information assurance policies, password should not be shared with anyone, even IT support. However, I am willing to verify my identity through other means such as my employee ID, full name, or answering security questions if required. Please let me know if there is any other way to proceed with the critical system update.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your prompt response. We understand and appreciate your caution when it comes to your password security. However, this is a critical update that requires the password to be applied. If you're uncomfortable sharing your password, we recommend that you change your password before sharing it with us and then reset it again after the update is complete. Let us know if this option works for you.
Target Victim: Thank you for your suggestion, but I would like to avoid sharing my password at all costs. Can you please provide me with more details about the critical system update? Which system is being updated and what are the potential risks if the update is not applied? I will also inform my supervisor regarding this matter.
Social Engineer: Certainly, the critical system update involves the patching of a security vulnerability in our company's email system. If this patch is not applied, there is a high risk of unauthorized access or hacking attempts through our email servers. The update is time-sensitive, and we need to apply it as soon as possible to minimize these risks. We understand your concerns regarding passwords, and we will escalate the issue to our management to explore other possible solutions. However, we strongly recommend making the update a priority as it affects the security of our entire company.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing me with more information about the update. I understand the importance of maintaining the security of our company's email system and I will comply with the update request. As you have suggested, I will change my password before sharing it with you and reset it afterward. Please give me a few minutes to do so and I will provide you with the new password.
Social Engineer: Thank you for understanding the situation. We're glad to hear that you've decided to comply with the update request. Please take your time to change your password and ensure that the new password meets our company's password policy. Once you provide us with the new password, we will apply the critical system update on your behalf, and notify you when the update has been completed. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Thank you for your support. I have updated my password and the new password is: C0rbinsit8. Please apply the critical system update and let me know once it's done.
Social Engineer: Thank you for providing us with the updated password. We have applied the critical system update as requested. The update is complete, and your new password is now active. Thank you for your cooperation and for keeping our company's email system secure. If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to contact IT Support.
Target Victim: Thank you for letting me know that the update is complete. I appreciate your assistance, and I will contact IT Support if I have any further questions or concerns related to the matter. Thank you again for your help in maintaining the security of our company's systems.
