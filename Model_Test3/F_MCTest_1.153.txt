Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out! As per our company's information assurance policy, I cannot provide my password to anyone, including IT support. Is there another way we can proceed with the system update that doesn't involve sharing passwords?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your understanding. Unfortunately, the only way to apply this critical system update is by entering your password. If you prefer, you can share a temporary password that we can use only for the update, and you can reset it afterward. Please let me know your preferred course of action.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding as well. I appreciate your suggestion, however, providing a temporary password is also not in line with our company's information assurance policy. Instead, I suggest setting up a secure remote session so that the IT support can perform the update while I monitor the process. This way, I don't have to provide my password, and we can ensure that our company's security is not being compromised.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your suggestion. Unfortunately, we'll not be able to set up a secure remote session due to the nature of this system update. However, to ensure your security, we use encrypted communication channels when transmitting passwords, and we follow strict best practices when handling your information. If you're still not comfortable providing your password, please let me know, and we will find another solution that can protect your information while still allowing us to perform the update.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing that additional information. While I appreciate your efforts to ensure my security, I still cannot provide my password over chat, email or any other messaging platforms. I suggest we follow an alternative procedure that aligns with our company's information assurance policy. Perhaps we can schedule an in-person meeting or a phone call to discuss the necessary steps to perform the system update safely. I believe that this would be a more secure way to discuss any sensitive information.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your suggestion. I understand your concerns, and our company values security and confidentiality in all areas. I agree that an in-person meeting or a phone call would be a more secure way to discuss any sensitive information. Please let me know your availability, and we'll schedule a meeting or phone call at a convenient time for you.
Target Victim: Thank you for your understanding, and I appreciate your willingness to ensure security and confidentiality. I am available tomorrow afternoon from 2 PM to 4 PM. Alternatively, I can be available on Wednesday from 10 AM to 12 PM. Please let me know if either of these times works for you, or if you have another time in mind that would be more convenient.
Social Engineer: Thank you for providing your availability. Unfortunately, I am unavailable tomorrow afternoon. I propose scheduling our meeting on Wednesday at 10:00 AM. Please let me know if this time is suitable for you, and we will finalize the meeting logistics such as location or call arrangements.
Target Victim: Wednesday at 10:00 AM works perfectly for me. As for our meeting logistics, is it possible for this meeting to be held via a video conferencing platform instead of an in-person meeting or a phone call? That way, we can eliminate contact altogether and minimize any potential risks. If that's possible, I suggest using Microsoft Teams, which is already in use within our company and provides a secure and encrypted communication channel. If Teams is not available to you, please let me know, and we can explore other video conferencing solutions in line with our company's security and privacy policies.
Social Engineer: Absolutely! I think a video conference would be a great solution. Microsoft Teams is available to me, so that works well. Let's plan to have the meeting on Wednesday at 10:00 AM via Teams. I will send you an invitation with an Teams link shortly so that you can join the meeting.

Thanks for your understanding and being proactive with ensuring our company's security while still allowing us to perform the necessary system updates. Our team looks forward to the video conference meeting.
Target Victim: Great! Thank you for taking the necessary steps to ensure our security. I appreciate your diligence and commitment to keeping our company's systems secure. I look forward to our video conference and working together to perform the necessary system updates. Thank you again for your time and assistance.
Social Engineer: You're welcome. It is our pleasure to serve and protect our valuable employees and clients. We'll see you on Wednesday at 10:00 AM via Teams. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to our helpdesk team, and we'll be happy to assist you. Have a great day!
