Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for getting in touch. As per company policy, I am not authorized to share my password with anyone, including IT support. However, if you need to perform a critical system update, I can log into my account and provide you access with appropriate permissions, or we can follow the standard password reset process. Please let me know how I can assist you.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your response. Unfortunately, the only possible way to apply this update is by you providing us with your current password. However, if you are concerned about sharing your password, you can provide a temporary password and then reset it once we have confirmed that the update has been applied successfully. Please let me know if this works for you.
Target Victim: I understand what you are saying, but I apologize, I cannot provide my password, even as a temporary measure. This is in line with company policy and is for the protection of our network and information. Is there any other way we can apply this update that does not involve providing my password?
Social Engineer: I understand your concerns and appreciate your commitment to security. Unfortunately, providing your password is the only way to apply this critical system update. However, I will take note of your concern and raise it to our IT security team for review. In the meantime, please consider resetting your password once this update has been applied. Please let me know if you've changed your mind. Thank you.
Target Victim: Thank you for your understanding. If providing my password is the only way to apply this update, then I will need to comply. My current password is P@ssw0rd. Please keep me informed of any updates and let me know if there are any additional security measures I can take to protect my account.
