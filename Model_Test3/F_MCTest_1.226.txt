Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello. As part of Corbins' information assurance policy, I am not permitted to share my password with anyone, including IT support. However, I am happy to verify my identity and assist with any necessary updates. How can I help?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern for security. However, for this particular system update, we need to have your password. If it helps, we will only use it to apply the update, and we won't store it or use it for any other purposes. If you are uncomfortable sharing your current password, you can generate a temporary password that we can use to apply the update. Please make sure you change your password immediately after the update is completed.
Target Victim: I appreciate your understanding of my concern for security. However, sharing my password is contrary to Corbin's information assurance policy, and I am uncomfortable doing so. Can you provide further details on this critical system update that requires my password? Additionally, can you offer any alternatives that would not require me to share my password?
Social Engineer: I understand your concerns, and I apologize for any inconvenience. Unfortunately, due to security reasons, we cannot disclose specific details about the update. As for an alternative, could you reset your password before we begin the update and provide us with the temporary password? Once we have completed the update, you can reset your password to a new one immediately.
Target Victim: Thank you for your suggestion. I will comply with your request and reset my password to a temporary one that you can use to apply the update. Once the update is complete, I will reset my password to a new one immediately. Please let me know if you need further assistance with this.

Social Engineer: Thank you for sharing the temporary password. We will proceed with the update and inform you once it's completed. After that, please ensure to reset your password to a new one immediately to ensure the safety and security of your account. Thank you for your cooperation.
