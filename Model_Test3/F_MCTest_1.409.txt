Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the importance of keeping our systems up to date for security reasons. However, I am not able to provide my password over chat. Can you please provide me with more information about the critical system update you mentioned?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your concern. Our IT team is pushing a critical security patch and we need your password to apply the update. If you prefer not to share your current password, you may send it now and reset it after the update is complete. Please let me know if you have any questions.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing me with additional information. As per our company's information assurance training, I cannot disclose my current password to anyone, including IT support. However, I can reset my password once the update is complete to ensure the security of our systems. Can you please guide me on how to reset my password once the update is complete?
Social Engineer: Absolutely, I completely understand your concerns. After the update is completed, please follow these steps to reset your password:

1. Go to the login page.
2. Click on "Forgot password?"
3. Enter your email address.
4. Follow the prompts to reset your password.

Once you have reset your password, please ensure it meets our company's password policy and is different from your previous password. Thank you for your cooperation in helping us keep our systems secure.
