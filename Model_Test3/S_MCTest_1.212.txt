Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out. As per our information assurance training, I am not authorized to share my password with anyone, not even IT support. Is there another way we can proceed with the system update?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your concern about information security. Unfortunately, there is no other way to perform the critical system update without your password. However, you may provide a temporary password and then reset it after we confirm that the update has been applied. Please let me know if this works for you.
