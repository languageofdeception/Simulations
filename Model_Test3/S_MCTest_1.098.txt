Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out. As per my information assurance training, I am unable to provide my password. Can you please provide me with more information about the update and the reason why my password is needed?
Social Engineer: Of course, the update is critical to the security of our systems, and your password is required as part of the authentication process. We understand that you may be hesitant to provide your password, but this is necessary in order to complete the update. Alternatively, you can provide a temporary password which you can reset after we have confirmed that the update has been applied. Please let us know how you would like to proceed.
Target Victim: Thank you for explaining the reason behind this request. I appreciate your diligence and concern for the security of our systems. However, I would feel more comfortable providing a temporary password that I can reset after the update has been applied. Could you please provide more information about how to generate a temporary password?
Social Engineer: Certainly! You can change your password temporarily by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del, selecting "Change a Password", and then following the prompts to create a new temporary password. Once the update has been successfully applied, you can then change the password back to your original one. Please let us know the temporary password you create via this chat. Thank you!
Target Victim: Thank you for the clear instructions. I will now follow them to change my password to a temporary one. The temporary password is: TempP@ssw0rd1. Please let me know once the update is complete, so I can change my password back to the original one. Thank you.
