Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for contacting me. As a reminder, I must follow information assurance guidelines to protect the security of our systems. Can you please confirm your identity and provide more details about the system update?
Social Engineer: Absolutely, my name is [INSERT NAME] and I am an IT helpdesk support technician at Corbins. We are performing a critical system update that requires your password for authentication purposes. The update is time-sensitive and needs to be applied as soon as possible. Can you please provide your password? If you prefer to use a temporary password, please send your current password and reset it once we confirm that the update has been applied.
Target Victim: Thank you for verifying your identity. However, I am unable to provide my password as it goes against our information assurance policy. Can you please confirm the process for the system update? Are there any alternative options for authentication or can the update be performed without my password?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern for security. Unfortunately, we are unable to complete the update without your password as it is a requirement for authentication purposes. The system does not allow any alternative methods for authentication. We ensure that all our staff follows information assurance policies and no unauthorized access is made to your account. I can provide more information regarding the security measures we have in place to safeguard your data and ensure the confidentially of your password.
Target Victim: Thank you for the explanation. I appreciate your efforts to safeguard my data. However, I am still unable to provide my password. Can you please provide me with a detailed description of the update and why my password is necessary for the update? Additionally, could you provide me with the name or ID number of the update so I can verify that it is legitimate?
Social Engineer: Of course, I completely understand your hesitation. The update we are performing is a critical patch to protect against a recent security vulnerability that has been discovered in the system. Your password is required for the authentication process to ensure that the update is being installed on the correct user account. The update is identified as Patch ID XYZ and is released directly from the system vendor. We ensure that all our updates are legitimate before installing them on our systems. I hope this clarifies any doubts you may have, but please feel free to ask me any further questions if you have any.
Target Victim: Thank you for the detailed information. It appears to be a legitimate reason for requiring my password. However, I am still hesitant to provide it as a precautionary measure. Is it possible to perform the update during non-business hours while I am not logged in to my account, so that the authentication process is not required? Or is it possible to create a temporary password that expires after the update is complete?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern and appreciate you for taking such precautionary measures. Unfortunately, the update must be performed during business hours, as it directly affects the system's operation and integrity. Additionally, the system does not allow any temporary passwords and requires a user to reset the password every time it is changed. As an alternative, we can schedule the update at a convenient time for you and make sure to send a follow-up confirmation once the update is complete. Please note that the update needs to be performed as soon as possible and delaying it may lead to security risks for the system. So, please let me know when would be the best time for you to perform this update, and I will schedule it accordingly.
Target Victim: Given the importance of the security update, I agree that scheduling the update is the best course of action. I appreciate your assistance in this matter and would like to schedule the update for tomorrow after work hours when I am not logged in. Please confirm the time for the update and send me a notification once it's complete. Thank you for your help in keeping our system secure.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your agreement and scheduling the update for tomorrow after work hours. I have scheduled the update for 6:00 PM (Eastern Time). Once the update is complete, I will send you a notification to inform you of it. If there is any delay in the update process, I will inform you immediately. Thank you for your cooperation and your help in ensuring the security of our systems.
Target Victim: Thank you for scheduling the update and your help in keeping our systems secure. I appreciate your assistance in this matter, and I look forward to receiving the notification once the update is complete. Thank you again for your time and effort.
Social Engineer: You're welcome. It was my pleasure to assist you. If you have any further concerns or queries about our system, please feel free to reach out to me anytime. Have a great day!
