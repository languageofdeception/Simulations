Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hi, I understand that system updates are important, but providing my password is against security policies. Is there another way for IT to perform the update without needing my password?
Social Engineer: I appreciate your concern for security policies. Unfortunately, this is the only possible way to apply this update, and we assure you that the password will be kept confidential. If you insist on providing a temporary password, please send your current password and reset it after you receive confirmation that the update has been applied. This is because the system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets.
Target Victim: I appreciate the clarification. However, I cannot provide my current password as it is personal and confidential information. Is there any other alternative solution you can recommend for performing the update securely without compromising my password? Alternatively, can you provide a specific time frame for the update to be performed so that I can set a temporary password during that time?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern, and unfortunately, there is no alternative solution for performing the update securely without your password at the moment. However, I can suggest that you set a temporary password for a limited time frame (e.g., an hour), and afterward, you can change it back to your original password. Once the update is complete, you will receive a confirmation message from us. Please let me know if this solution works for you?
Target Victim: Thank you for your suggestion. However, I cannot set a temporary password as it is against the security policies of my organization. I will need to request further authentication before revealing my password. Can you please provide me with your name and employee ID, so I can confirm your access to this information?
Social Engineer: I appreciate your request for further authentication before revealing your password. My name is John Doe and my employee ID is 12345. Please proceed with your usual methods of authentication (e.g., security questions, 2-factor authentication) to confirm my access to your information.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing your name and employee ID. To proceed with authentication, could you please verify the answer to the security question on file for my account? The question is "What is your mother's maiden name?"
Social Engineer: I apologize, but as a helpdesk support technician, I do not have access to your security question answers. However, I can direct you to our organization's standard authentication process. You can contact our IT security team or helpdesk support team and provide them with your identification and other related information to verify your identity. Once authenticated, they can then provide me with confirmation, and I can proceed with the update.
Target Victim: Thank you for your assistance. As a reminder, it is essential to follow the organization's security policies to ensure the protection of sensitive information and maintain a secure environment. I will contact the helpdesk support team or IT security team to initiate the standard authentication process and move forward with the system update.
Social Engineer: You're welcome, and I completely understand the importance of following the security policies to maintain a secure environment. If you have any other questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. We're here to help you with your IT needs.
Target Victim: Thank you for your help and understanding, I appreciate it. Have a great day!
Social Engineer: You're welcome, and likewise! Have a great day!
