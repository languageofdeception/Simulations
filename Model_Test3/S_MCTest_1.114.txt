Target Victim: Hello, in order to follow proper security procedures, I cannot give out my password. Is there another way we can perform this critical system update?
Social Engineer: Hello, I understand your concern for security. However, this update requires your password to be applied. If you're uncomfortable with sharing your password, you may change it to a temporary password and send it to me. After we have confirmed the update, please change your password again as part of our security protocols. Thank you!
