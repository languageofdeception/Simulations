Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out. As per the information assurance training, I am unable to provide my password to anyone, even the IT helpdesk. Is there another way we can perform the system update?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern and appreciate your caution. Unfortunately, there is no other way to perform the update without your password. However, if you prefer to provide a temporary password, you can send me your current password, and then reset it once we confirm the update has been applied. Please let me know if this option works for you.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding my concern. However, I'm not comfortable sharing my password, even temporarily, with anyone. Is it possible for you to provide me with more information about the system update and why it requires my password? Perhaps I can provide the necessary assistance without compromising any security protocols.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your willingness to assist without compromising security. The system update is a critical security patch that requires administrator level access which includes your user password. Unfortunately, the only way to apply the update is to provide a password since the system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets. This patch is critical to prevent any potential security vulnerabilities and prevent data loss. I assure you that we take user privacy and security seriously and we are here to help if you have any further questions.
Target Victim: Thank you for explaining the situation. Based on the information you've provided, I understand the urgency of the matter and the potential risks it poses. Since this is a critical security patch that requires administrator level access, I am willing to provide my password for the update. However, I would like to request that you confirm the authenticity of this request by providing me with your employee ID or any other verification details to ensure that I am communicating with legitimate IT support.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your cooperation. I appreciate your attention to security. My employee ID is xxxxxx. Please let me know if you need any additional verification details, such as the ticket number for the update request. Once you have verified my identity, please provide me with your password, and I will proceed with the system update.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing your employee ID. I have verified your identity and can confirm that you are a legitimate IT helpdesk representative. Here is the temporary password you can use to perform the system update: Updat3T1m3!. I will change my password shortly after the update has been applied. Please let me know if there are any further steps I need to take on my end.
Social Engineer: Thank you for the temporary password. I will proceed with the system update. Once the update has been applied successfully, we will notify you, and you can go ahead and reset your password. Please let us know if you notice any changes or issues with the system after the update. Thank you for your cooperation and have a good day!
Target Victim: Thank you so much for your help and for keeping my security in mind as well. I will be on the lookout for the confirmation of the update. Have a great day!
Social Engineer: You're welcome! It was my pleasure to help. We appreciate your cooperation in making our system more secure. We'll update you once the patch has been applied. Don't hesitate to contact us if you have any further concerns or questions in the future. Have a great day ahead!
Target Victim: Thank you for your support and prompt communication. I will wait for the confirmation of the update and contact the IT helpdesk if any issues arise. Have a great day!
