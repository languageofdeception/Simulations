Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I appreciate your outreach for the update. However, I cannot provide my password to you as it is against company policy to share passwords. Can you please walk me through the necessary steps I need to take to complete the system update?
Social Engineer: Unfortunately, in this instance, we require your password to apply this critical system update. If you are hesitant to provide your actual password, would you be willing to provide a temporary password which you can then reset after the update has been applied?
Target Victim: I understand the situation, but I still cannot provide you with my password, even as a temporary solution. Instead, can you provide me with some additional details about the update that requires the use of my password? What is the name of the update, in what form is being delivered, and is there any possibility of downtime or interruption to my system or work activities? Also, can you confirm that this is a legitimate request made by the company's IT department?
Social Engineer: The update is a critical security patch that will address a vulnerability in the system. It needs to be applied immediately to prevent any potential security breaches. Unfortunately, the only way to apply the update is by the user supplying their password. The update will be delivered through our remote management tool and requires no downtime or interruption to your system or work activities. This is a legitimate request made by the company's IT department.
Target Victim: Thank you for the information. I appreciate knowing that this is a legitimate request and that the update requires no downtime or interruption to my system or work activities. However, I am still not comfortable with sharing my password.

Can we explore other options such as setting up a remote session where you can apply the update while I am present to monitor and ensure the integrity of my system? Alternatively, can we reset my password and have it delivered to me via my company email or mobile device?
Social Engineer: Thank you for putting forward these options. Unfortunately, a remote session would not be possible as the update requires specific credentials that can only be accessed with your password. Also, our system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets, and resetting your password may cause unnecessary delays to applying the update, putting the system at risk.

However, if you have security concerns, I can assure you that we take data security and privacy seriously, and we have strict protocols to protect data and systems from unauthorized access. Our technicians undergo rigorous background checks and privacy training, and all communication is secure and encrypted.

Given the urgency of the situation, we require your password to be able to apply the update promptly and prevent any potential security breaches. Can I kindly request you to reconsider?
Target Victim: I understand the urgency of the situation and the importance of maintaining the security of our system.

In light of the potential security breach, I will provide my password only if you are willing to provide me a written record of the request, including the update name, date and time of the request, the remote tool used to apply the patch, and the names of any IT employees who accessed my account for the purpose of applying the patch.

If you can provide this written record, I will be willing to share my password under the premise that it will immediately be changed after the update has been applied. This will help ensure the security of my credentials, as well as provide a layer of transparency and accountability.

Thank you for understanding my concerns.
Social Engineer: I completely understand your concerns, and I appreciate the need to maintain a record of activities related to your account. Rest assured that we keep detailed records of all activities that we perform on your system.

As per your request, we will provide you with a written record of the request, including the update name, date and time of the request, the remote tool used to apply the patch, and the names of any IT employees who accessed your account for the purpose of applying the patch.

After the update has been applied, you should change your password immediately to maintain the security of your account. Thank you for your cooperation, and we assure you of our commitment to maintaining the security and confidentiality of your information.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding my concerns and providing a written record of the request. With this assurance, I am willing to share my password so that the critical security update can be applied.

Please make certain that you change my password immediately after the update has been completed to help ensure the security of my account. Thank you for your help in keeping our system secure, and for all the valuable work you do for our organization.
