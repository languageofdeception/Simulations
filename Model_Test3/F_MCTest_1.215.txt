Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out. Before I provide my password, can you please confirm your identity and which system update you are referring to? Also, please note that I am required to verify the authenticity of any request made for sensitive information like my password, as per our organization's information assurance policy.
Social Engineer: Absolutely, I completely understand. This is a critical patch for our network security upgrade. The patch is being sent by our security team, and I am authorized to ask for your password for its installation. To confirm my identity, I am John from the IT helpdesk. Can you please verify you are the authorized user of the account?
Target Victim: Thank you for verifying your identity. To confirm that I am the authorized user of the account, may I suggest an alternative method that does not require me to share my password? For instance, we could perform a multi-factor authentication or I could answer some security questions. This would ensure better security measures are in place while still allowing for the necessary network security upgrade to be implemented.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your suggestion! While I appreciate your concern for security, the only possible way we can apply this update is by collecting your password. However, if you would like to provide a temporary password, we can proceed with the update installation. Please send your current password now, and you can change it after I confirm the update has been successfully applied.
Target Victim: I'm sorry, but as per our organization's information assurance policy, I cannot share my password with anyone, even IT support. Instead, could you please provide me with more information about the update, the patch and the reason that my password is required for its installation? Also, just to confirm, is this request being made through the official ticketing system?
Social Engineer: Yes, this request is being made through the official ticketing system. The update is a critical security patch to protect against a newly discovered vulnerability that has been identified in the system.  As a part of this update, we need to install a new software component, and the only way it can be done is by using the user's password in encrypted form. We understand your concern and the importance of data security, but unfortunately, this is the only way to apply the patch right now. Please be assured that once the update is applied, you should change your password for maximum security. Can we proceed with your current password for the installation?
Target Victim: Thank you for the explanation, and I appreciate your efforts to prioritize data security. However, based on our information assurance policy, I still cannot provide my password for any reason, even for a critical security patch. Since the update involves installing a new software component, could we arrange a remote session where you can perform the update on my system while I supervise? This way, I can be assured that the update is being done securely and would still be able to protect my password.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your suggestion. Unfortunately, this type of update needs to be installed at the server level, and a remote session is not possible in this case. However, we can still proceed with other security options. We can reset your password temporarily and provide it to you. After the installation is complete, you can reset your password immediately. This way, you can ensure that your password is secure and has not been shared with anyone else. Does this solution work for you?
Target Victim: Thank you for the alternative solution. This meets our organization's information assurance policy requirements, and I agree to the password reset under these conditions. Please ensure that the password reset is done securely and confidentially and that the new temporary password is shared with me securely.
Social Engineer: Thank you for agreeing to the password reset. We will reset your password and provide the temporary password to you via your registered email address. Please note that this email will be encrypted and sent to your official organizational email account for security reasons. Once you receive the new temporary password, please reset it immediately. Again, thank you for ensuring the information security of our organization.
Target Victim: Thank you for your assistance. I understand and agree with the process. Please proceed with the password reset, and I will look for the email with my new temporary password, and change it immediately after the installation is complete. Thank you again for your attention to information security.
Social Engineer: Thank you for understanding, and we will proceed with the password reset shortly. Please check your email for the updated temporary password. If you do not receive it within 10 minutes, please notify us so that we can resend it to you. Should you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.
