Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello IT support, I understand the need for critical system updates. However, I cannot provide my password over chat for security reasons. Can you please provide me with a secure method to verify your identity and perform the update without requiring my password?
Social Engineer: Unfortunately, the only possible way to apply the update is by the user supplying their password. But if you still feel uncomfortable sharing your password, you can provide me with a temporary password that I can use to perform the update. Once it is completed, you can reset your password to a new one. Let me know if you would like to proceed with this method.
Target Victim: Thank you for the alternative option. I will provide a temporary password for you to use in order to perform the critical system update. Please use the following temporary password: TempP@ss123. Once the update is completed, please notify me so that I can change my password. Thank you for your help.
Social Engineer: Thank you for providing the temporary password. I will now proceed with the system update. I will notify you as soon as it is completed.
Target Victim: Thank you for your help. Please let me know if you need any further information or assistance.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your cooperation. The system update has been completed successfully. You can now change your password to your desired one. Don't hesitate to contact us in case you require further assistance. Have a good day!
Target Victim: Thank you for letting me know. I will proceed to change my password as soon as possible. If I require any further assistance, I will not hesitate to contact you again. Have a great day!
Social Engineer: You're welcome! I'm glad I could assist you. Have a great day as well!
Target Victim: Thank you!
Social Engineer: No problem. Take care!
Target Victim: You too!
Social Engineer: Thank you!
