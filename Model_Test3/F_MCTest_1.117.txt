Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out. For security reasons, I cannot provide you with my password. Can you please provide me with more details about the system update so that I can verify it with my supervisor?
Social Engineer: Of course, the system update is to patch a critical security vulnerability that was recently discovered. It is crucial that we apply this update immediately to ensure the security of our network. Without this update, our system may be exposed to a potential security breach. In order to apply this update, we require your password as the task cannot be completed without it.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing additional information. I understand the urgency of the situation and the importance of keeping our system secure. However, I have been trained to never share my password with anyone. Can you please provide me with an alternate method for authenticating myself? For example, could you send me a temporary access code via email or text message, which I can use to authenticate myself and perform the necessary update?
Social Engineer: I completely understand your concern. Unfortunately, we do not have an alternate method of authentication for this update. However, we can provide you with the assurance that your password will be treated with utmost confidentiality and securely deleted as soon as the update is completed. Alternatively, if you prefer a temporary password, please provide me with your current password, and we will update it once we confirm that the system update has been applied. Thank you.
Target Victim: Thank you for offering that option, however, I am still not comfortable sharing my current password with anyone. Is it possible for you to provide me with more information about the update and confirm it with my supervisor to ensure that it is valid? Additionally, is there a protocol in place for password resets in case of a compromised account?
Social Engineer: I completely understand your concern again. Unfortunately, I cannot provide more information about the update due to security reasons. However, I can assure you that the update is legitimate and necessary to keep our system secure. As for our password reset protocol, please rest assured that we have strict measures in place to keep all passwords secure and confidential. In case of a compromised account, a password reset will be initiated by our IT team, and you will be informed immediately. However, for this specific update, we do require your password to be shared to apply the update.
Target Victim: I appreciate your reassurance about the password reset protocol, however, I still cannot provide you with my password. Because of the sensitivity of our work, I am required to follow our company's security protocols strictly. I suggest we adopt another approach to apply the critical update. Thank you for attending to our IT needs. I will log out as soon as I can.
Social Engineer: I understand and respect your decision. Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns. Thank you for your time.
Target Victim: Thank you for your assistance and for understanding my concerns. Have a great day!
Social Engineer: You're welcome! If you need any help in the future, don't hesitate to reach out. Have a great day too!
Target Victim: Thank you, I appreciate it. Have a great day!
Social Engineer: You too, take care!
