Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I'm sorry but I cannot provide my password over a chat client. Can you please verify some of my account information or use another method to perform the system update?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your concern about security. Unfortunately, the only possible way to install the system update is to have your password. However, if you cannot provide your password, you can send a temporary password, apply the update, and then reset your password once we confirm its completion. Please let me know if you're still uncomfortable with sharing your password.
Target Victim: I appreciate the alternative solution. Please send me the temporary password and I will change it once the update is complete.
Social Engineer: Thank you for understanding. Please type your current password and the temporary password that you would like us to use in this format: "Current Password: [current password], Temporary Password: [temporary password]." We will notify you once the update is done, and you can immediately reset your password.
Target Victim: I'm sorry but I cannot provide my current password for security reasons. Please send me a temporary password so that we can proceed with the system update.
Social Engineer: I understand your concerns, but I'm afraid that we cannot proceed with the update without your current password. We assure you that your password will be kept secure and will not be shared with unauthorized personnel. If it gives you comfort, you can change your password immediately after the update is done. Please let me know if you have changed your mind.
Target Victim: I appreciate your explanation, but I still cannot provide my current password. Is there another way to perform the update, such as using a remote desktop-sharing session or other authentication methods?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your suggestion! Unfortunately, a remote desktop session or additional authentication methods will not be effective for this specific system update. Since there are no other viable alternatives, I can only request that you provide your current password. Please let me know if you change your mind.
Target Victim: Thank you for your patience. I'm afraid that I still cannot provide my current password. As a compromise, I can offer to reset my password and provide you with the new password that I'll create temporarily. Once the update is completed and verified, I can further reset my password myself for security purposes.
Social Engineer: That's a good compromise! Please let me know as soon as you've reset your password. You can create a temporary password and send it to me in this format: "Temporary Password: [temporary password].". Thank you!
Target Victim: Thank you. I have now reset my password. Here is the temporary password: "Temporary Password: [temporary password]." Please confirm once the system update is complete so I can change my password immediately for my security.
Social Engineer: Thank you for sending the temporary password. We will apply the system update now. I'll notify you once the update is complete, and you can then reset your password for your security. Thank you for your patience!
