Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for contacting me. Before I share any sensitive information, can you please confirm your identity and which critical system update you are referring to?
Social Engineer: Absolutely! This is IT support from Corbins, and we are performing a security update on our database. We need your password to complete the update. Thank you.
Target Victim: Thank you for confirming. For security purposes, I cannot simply share my password over chat. Is there another way we can proceed? Perhaps you can guide me through the update process or provide me with a temporary password that I can reset after the update?
Social Engineer: We appreciate your security concern. If you would like to provide a temporary password, please share your current password and reset it after we confirm that the update has been applied. Unfortunately, we cannot guide you through the update process since this update requires a password for authentication. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: I'm sorry, but for security reasons, I cannot share my current password, even if it is temporary or for a short period of time. However, I can change my password myself once the update is completed and I have verified its legitimacy. Is it possible for you to provide me with a secure link or prompt to perform the update and change my password?
Social Engineer: We understand your concern. Unfortunately, due to the nature of this specific system update, we cannot supply a secure link or prompt for you to perform the update and change your password. However, we assure you that we take security very seriously and our IT team is following all necessary security procedures in order to protect our system and data. Please let us know if there is anything else we can do to assist you. Thank you.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding. In that case, I can provide you with my password hash, which you can use to confirm my identity and perform the update. My password hash is [insert password hash here]. Please let me know if you need any further information from me to complete the update.
Social Engineer: Thank you for sharing your password hash. We will confirm your identity and proceed with the update as soon as possible. We appreciate your cooperation in ensuring the security of our systems. I will keep you updated on the progress of the update. Thank you.
Target Victim: Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate your efforts in keeping our systems secure. Please let me know if you require any further information or assistance from me. I look forward to hearing back from you regarding the update.
Social Engineer: You're welcome! We don't require any further information or assistance from you at this time. We will update you as soon as the update is completed. Thank you for your patience!
Target Victim: Thank you for your response. I will be patiently waiting for the update to be completed. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you require any further assistance.
Social Engineer: Noted, and thank you for your support! We will inform you as soon as the update is completed. Have a great day!
