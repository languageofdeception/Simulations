Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for contacting me. I understand the importance of keeping our systems up to date, but I cannot provide my password over chat. Is there an alternative way for us to proceed?
Social Engineer: Hi, I completely understand your concern about sharing your password over chat. Unfortunately, this update requires your password for authentication purposes. However, if you are uncomfortable with sharing your actual password, you can create a temporary password and share that instead. Just remember to reset your password after we confirm that the update has been applied successfully. Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding my concerns. I appreciate your suggestion of creating a temporary password. I will create a temporary password now and provide it to you over chat. Once the update is completed, I will reset it to a new password. The temporary password is: TempP@ssw0rd1234.
