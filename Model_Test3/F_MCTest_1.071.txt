Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, as per the company's information assurance policies, I am not authorized to disclose my password over chat unless it's an emergency situation. Can you please provide more details about the critical system update and why it requires my password?
Social Engineer: Certainly. We are currently performing a system update that requires access to your account in order to apply the necessary changes. We assure you that your password will only be used for the update process and will not be shared or stored outside of the update procedure. We understand your concern about password security, so we recommend that you send your current password and then reset it after receiving confirmation that the update has been applied. Can you please provide your password now?
Target Victim: Thank you for providing me with more details about the update. As an employee of Corbins, I understand the importance of security and want to ensure that we protect our systems from unauthorized access. However, I cannot provide my password over the chat client since it can compromise the security of my account. Instead, I can change my password and provide you with the new one. Please let me know if this is acceptable so I can proceed with changing my password.
Social Engineer: Thank you for understanding the importance of security. We appreciate your cooperation and would recommend that you reset your password immediately after we've completed the update. Please do let me know the new password so we can proceed with the update process.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding my concerns. I have just changed my password to: Corbins123! Please use this new password for the update process. And I will go ahead and reset my password after the update is completed. Let me know if there's anything else you need from me.
Social Engineer: Thank you for the quick response. We've received your new password: Corbins123! and will proceed with the update process. Once it's completed, we will notify you so you can reset your password. If you have any further issues or concerns, don't hesitate to contact us. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Thank you for letting me know. I appreciate your help and am looking forward to the completed update. If there are any further actions required from me, please let me know.
Social Engineer: You're welcome! We will keep you updated on the progress of the update and if any further actions are required from you. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns please don't hesitate to contact us. Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.
