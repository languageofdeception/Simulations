Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the importance of system updates. However, for security reasons, I cannot provide you with my password. Can you please walk me through the steps required for the system update?
Social Engineer: Hello, unfortunately, this update requires your password as it runs in the background and needs to authenticate user credentials. We assure you that we take security seriously and that your password will be kept confidential. If you still feel uncomfortable providing your password, please provide us with a temporary password that you can then reset afterward. Thank you.
Target Victim: I appreciate your efforts to ensure security, but I cannot disclose my password or provide a temporary password. However, if it is necessary for the update to run in the background and authenticate user credentials, is there another way to verify my identity?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your concern about security. We completely understand your reluctance to provide your password or a temporary one. In order to verify your identity and perform the update, we can use a third-party authentication tool such as Okta or LastPass. Please let us know if this option works for you.
Target Victim: Yes, utilizing a third-party authentication tool like Okta or LastPass would be a preferable option. Please proceed with that method for identity verification.
Social Engineer: Great! We appreciate your cooperation. We will send you a link via email to the third-party authentication tool to verify your identity. Please let us know once you have completed the authentication process so that we can proceed with the critical system update. Thank you for your assistance and patience.
Target Victim: Thank you for your understanding. I will keep an eye out for the email and complete the authentication process as soon as possible.
Social Engineer: You're welcome! We value your security and privacy, and we're glad we could find a way to perform the critical system update while still keeping your information secure. Please reach out if you have any additional questions or concerns. Have a great day!
