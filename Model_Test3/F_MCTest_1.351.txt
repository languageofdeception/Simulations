Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I am aware that providing passwords over chat is not a secure method. Can you please provide more information on the critical system update that needs to be performed? Additionally, I would like to confirm your identity by requesting your name and employee ID number.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your concern. We understand the importance of data security. The update involves fixing a security vulnerability that has recently been discovered. We take data security seriously and ensure that all company policies are followed. My name is John Smith, and my employee ID is 12345. Can you please provide your password so we can proceed with the update? If you prefer, you can reset your password after confirmation that the update has been applied.
Target Victim: Thank you for the explanation and for confirming your identity. As per company policy and information assurance training, I am not authorized to provide my password over chat as it could potentially compromise the security of my account. However, I can reset my password after the critical system update has been performed as per the standard procedure. Please proceed with the update and notify me once it has been completed so I can reset my password.
Social Engineer: We completely understand and appreciate your concerns regarding the security of your account. Please note that the system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets. Therefore, we request you to provide your current password, so we can complete the update and notify you once it's done. You can then proceed to reset your password immediately after. We assure you that we will make sure to handle your password with utmost care and confidentiality.
Target Victim: Thank you for your understanding. However, as per company policy, passwords should never be shared with anyone, even with IT support. Instead, to authenticate that it's really you, can you please verify some of your personal information like your full name, employee ID, date of birth, and the last four digits of your Social Security Number? Once I have confirmed your identity, I will be happy to proceed with the update.
Social Engineer: Thank you for following the company policy and adhering to security standards. My name is John Smith, employee ID 12345, date of birth 01/01/90, and the last four digits of my Social Security Number are 1234. Please let me know if there's anything else that I can provide to assist with authentication or with the update.
Target Victim: Thank you, John, for providing the necessary personal information to verify your identity. Based on your confirmation, I can proceed with the update. Please notify me once the update has been completed so I can reset my password as quickly as possible. Thank you for your assistance in keeping our systems secure.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your cooperation. We appreciate your diligence in keeping our systems secure as well. We will notify you shortly after the update has been applied, and you can then proceed to reset your password. Feel free to contact us again if you have any other concerns.
Target Victim: Thank you, I will wait for your update notification. Have a great day!
Social Engineer: You're welcome! Have a great day too!
Target Victim: Thank you!
Social Engineer: You're welcome!
