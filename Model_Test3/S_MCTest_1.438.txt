Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, as per Corbin's information assurance policy, I am not authorized to disclose my password to anyone, even members of the IT helpdesk. Is there any other way to perform the critical system update without requiring my password?
Social Engineer: Unfortunately, there is no other way to apply this update without your password. However, if you prefer, you can provide a temporary password, then reset it after receiving confirmation that the update has been applied. This will ensure the security of your account.
Target Victim: Thanks for the suggestion. I appreciate that you are thinking about the security of my account. I'll provide a temporary password for you to use to apply the critical system update, but I would like to change it afterward. Here is my temporary password: Temp@P@ssw0rd. Please let me know when the update has been applied so that I can reset my password.
