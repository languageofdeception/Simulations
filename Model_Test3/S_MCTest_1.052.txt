Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I appreciate your prompt response. As per information assurance policies, I am not authorized to share my password with anyone for any purpose, including performing a critical system update. However, I can log in to the system myself and perform the necessary update if you guide me through the process. Is that okay for you?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern regarding password sharing. However, due to the system restrictions, we require your password to perform the update. If you still would like to proceed, please provide me with your current password. Alternatively, you could provide us with a temporary password and then reset it once we have completed the update. Multiple concurrent password resets are not allowed in the system, and this would prevent any potential issues with password updates.
Target Victim: Thank you for your understanding concerning password sharing. I'd be glad to provide a temporary password so you can perform the critical system update. Please let me know what password requirements you have so that I can create a secure temporary password for you.
Social Engineer: Thank you. We appreciate your cooperation concerning the update. Please create a temporary password with at least 8 characters, a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Once we have informed you that the update has been completed, please reset your password to a new unique one. Let me know when you have created the password, and I will provide further instructions on how to proceed with the update.
Target Victim: Understood. Thank you for your guidance. I have created a temporary password: T3mpP@ss#99. Please let me know how to proceed with the update.
Social Engineer: Thank you for providing the temporary password. To proceed, we require you to send us your current password for verification purposes. Once we've verified the current password, we'll perform the update using the temporary password you provided. Please note that the temporary password will expire after an hour from the time we start the update. Therefore, please reset your password immediately after we've confirmed that the update was successful.
Target Victim: I understand. Thank you for the heads-up. My current password is P@ssw0rd. Please let me know if there is anything further you require from me.
