Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out. Before I provide you with my password, can you please verify your identity by providing me with your name and employee ID?
Social Engineer: Of course, my name is Jane and my employee ID is 1234. May I have your password now, please?
Target Victim: Thank you for verifying your identity, Jane. I apologize, but I am unable to provide you with my password due to security reasons. Can you please explain in more detail the critical system update that needs to be performed and what steps I can take to ensure my information is protected?
Social Engineer: Certainly, we need your password to perform a one-time critical system update. This update requires your password to authenticate and apply the necessary changes. We understand your concerns for security and want to let you know that we take your privacy very seriously. If you prefer, you can provide us with a temporary password that we can use to complete the update. Once the update is done, you can change your password as you see fit. Please let me know which option you prefer.
Target Victim: Thank you for explaining, Jane. I appreciate your concern for my privacy. In this instance, I would feel more comfortable providing you with a temporary password that I will change immediately after the update. The temporary password will be Temp@P@ssw0rd. Please let me know if that works.
