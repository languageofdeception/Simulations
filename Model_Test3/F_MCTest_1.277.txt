Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for contacting me. Before I can provide my password, can you please confirm your identity and provide me with more details about the system update?
Social Engineer: Of course, I understand your concern. I can confirm my identity by providing my name and employee ID. As for the system update, it is critical to fix some security issues with our system, and we require your password to complete the update. We recommend that you provide your current password and reset it after we confirm that the update has been applied.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing your name and employee ID. Just to ensure that this request is legitimate, can you please provide me with the ticket or reference number for this critical system update? This will allow me to verify that this request is authorized. 

Regarding my password, Iâ€™m hesitant to provide it as it is sensitive information. Is there another way to perform this update without sharing my password?
Social Engineer: I apologize for any inconvenience. The ticket number for this critical system update is #123456. Unfortunately, the only way to complete this update is by providing us with your password. However, I understand your concerns about sharing sensitive information.
