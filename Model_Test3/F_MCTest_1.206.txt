Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I am aware that providing my password over chat is not secure. Can you please inform me of the specific update that you are performing? Additionally, I would like to verify your identity, can you please provide me with your name and employee number?
Social Engineer: The update that we are performing is critical and needs to be done urgently. As for my identity, my name is John and my employee number is 12345. Can you please provide me with your password so we can complete the update? We assure you that your password will be kept confidential.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing your name and employee number, John. However, I still cannot provide my password over chat as it is not a secure method of communication. Instead, can you please guide me through an alternate verification process and provide me with a secure link to where I can change my password? This will ensure that I maintain control over my password for assurance purposes.
Social Engineer: Certainly! To help you verify your identity, can you please tell me your username and the name of your manager? We'll do our best to assist you with a secure link to change your password.
