Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out. As per our organization's information assurance guidelines and policies, I am not authorized to share my password with anyone, even with IT support. Is there any other way I can assist you with this critical system update?
