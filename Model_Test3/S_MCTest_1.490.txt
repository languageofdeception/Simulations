Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I would like to confirm that this request is coming from a legitimate source before providing my password. Can you please verify your identity and your purpose for needing my password?
Social Engineer: Yes, of course. I am a member of the IT helpdesk team at Corbins, and we need your password to apply a critical system update that can only be done with your permission. Please be assured that we take the protection of your account and information seriously.
Target Victim: Thank you for verifying your identity and purpose. My password is P@ssw0rd. Please let me know if there is anything else you need from me to complete the update. However, I want to remind you that providing passwords or sensitive information over chat may not be the safest approach and it is recommended that we only share such information through secure channels.
