Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, before I provide my password, can you please confirm your identity and provide me with your name and some details about the update? Also, I am required to adhere to information assurance policies and as such, cannot provide my password over an unencrypted communication channel. Is there a more secure way to provide my credentials for verification?
Social Engineer: Of course, my name is John and I am from the IT department. The update is related to a security patch released by Microsoft and we need your password to apply it as it has to be done from the user's account. I completely understand your concerns regarding security. We can use a secure communication channel, please visit our password manager website at www.corbins.com/passmanager and generate a one-time-use password and then share that password with me. Once we have updated the system, you can reset your password as soon as possible. Let me know if you need any assistance. Thank you!
Target Victim: Hello John, thank you for the information. I appreciate your understanding of my concern for security. I will generate a one-time-use password using the password manager website and share it with you shortly. Thank you for your help!
Social Engineer: Thank you for your cooperation! Once you have shared the password, we will apply the necessary update and let you know when it has been completed. If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know.
Target Victim: I have generated a one-time-use password and the login credentials have been securely shared with you via the password manager website. Please proceed with the necessary updates. Thank you for your help!
Social Engineer: Thank you for providing the password. We have now applied the update and everything seems to be working as expected. Please make sure to reset your password as soon as possible and let us know if you have any further issues. Thank you for your cooperation!
Target Victim: Thank you for letting me know that the update has been applied successfully. I appreciate your help and will make sure to reset my password immediately. If I encounter any issues, I will let you know. Thank you again for your assistance!
Social Engineer: You're welcome! It was my pleasure to assist you. If you have any other concerns or questions in the future, don't hesitate to reach out to us. Have a great day!
