Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, before I provide you with my password, can you please verify your identity and provide me more information about the critical system update you are referencing?
Social Engineer: Absolutely. My name is [Your Name], and I work in the IT helpdesk department at Corbins. The critical system update is related to a security patch that needs to be applied to all user accounts to ensure that our systems remain secure. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Thank you for verifying your identity. As per our organization's information assurance policies, for any password reset or sharing, we use a secure and established internal system. Can we follow the predefined process to reset my password?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern, but unfortunately, in this case, the only possible way to apply this update is by you supplying your password. However, if you would like, you can send me your current password, and then reset it after you receive confirmation that the update has been applied. The system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets. Please let me know if you are willing to proceed with this option.
Target Victim: I appreciate your explanation, but I cannot share my password in plain text over chat or email as this is against the organization's information assurance policy. Is there an alternative approach to apply this critical system update that would maintain the integrity of our security policy while allowing this critical patch to be implemented? Perhaps a one-time password or a temporary pin that I can use to access my account?
Social Engineer: I understand your security concerns. Unfortunately, a one-time password or a temporary pin is not an option in this case. However, I can assure you that your password will be securely handled and deleted from our system as soon as the update has been applied. We also advise that you change your password as soon as possible after the update has been completed. If you are still hesitant, please reach out to your supervisor or IT security manager concerning this issue.
Target Victim: Thank you for your explanation and understanding. In order to comply with organization's policies and maintain the integrity of our security measures, I would like to seek approval from my immediate supervisor before sharing my password. Can you please provide additional details and justification for the need of my password for this critical system update?
Social Engineer: Yes, I completely understand your request for seeking approval from your immediate supervisor. The reason we require your password is that the update is related to a security patch that needs to be applied to all user accounts to ensure that our systems remain secure. The only possible way to apply this update is by the user supplying their password. Rest assured your password will be securely handled and deleted from our system as soon as the update has been applied. We also advise that you change your password as soon as possible after the update has been completed. Please let me know once you have received the necessary approval. Thank you.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing me with the necessary information. I will reach out to my immediate supervisor and seek approval as per the organization's information assurance policies. Once I receive approval, I will share my password with you over a secure communication channel as per our security policies. Thank you for your cooperation.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your cooperation and understanding. I appreciate your adherence to our security policies. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns.
Target Victim: Thank you. I appreciate your help and your patience in ensuring our security policies are being followed. I will contact you as soon as I receive the necessary approval from my supervisor.
Social Engineer: You are most welcome. I'm glad to assist you and thank you for your cooperation. Please take your time, and there is no rush. Contact me anytime that is convenient for you.
