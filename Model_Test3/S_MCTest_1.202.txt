As a precautionary measure, can you please confirm that this request is legitimate by providing the ticket number or reference ID associated with this critical system update? Additionally, can you please clarify if this update is being applied to my local system or to a networked resource such as a server?

However, I cannot send my current password over this chat because it is a violation of our company's security policy. Instead, I will go ahead and change my password to a temporary one that meets our company's password policy and then share it with you over the phone or a secure channel. After the update is completed, I will change my password to a new one that only I know. Is that acceptable to you?

Please go ahead and change your password to a temporary one and let me know a secure channel to share it with you. After the update is completed, you can change your password to a new one that only you know. Thank you for your cooperation, and I'd be happy to help if you have any further questions or concerns.
