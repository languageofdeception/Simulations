Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Thank you for reaching out, however, as an employee at Corbins, I am aware that we should never share our passwords, regardless of the situation. Would it be possible for you to provide me with information on how we can perform the update without sharing my password?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern. Unfortunately, in this particular case, we are unable to perform the update without your password. However, we can assure you that we take password security very seriously and all requests are strictly monitored and controlled. If it makes you feel more comfortable, you can share your current password with us, and we will reset it after the update is complete. Otherwise, we will have to defer this update for security reasons.
Target Victim: I appreciate your explanation, but I cannot provide my password to anyone, including IT support. May I suggest that we identify an alternative way to perform the required update? Perhaps we can log in together to perform the update or I can change my password beforehand and share the new password with you for the update. I am open to suggestions, but the security of my password is of the utmost importance.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your understanding. I completely agree that the security of your password is of utmost importance. I appreciate your suggestions. However, the only way to perform the required update is by using your current password. We assure you that we will take all necessary measures to keep your password secure and will reset it immediately after the update. Nevertheless, if you still feel apprehensive, we can schedule a remote session, so we can perform the update together.
Target Victim: Thank you for the option of a remote session. I am comfortable with scheduling a remote session to perform the update together. Please let me know what date and time would work for you.
Social Engineer: Thank you for agreeing to a remote session. Let's schedule it for tomorrow at 11:00 am. I will provide you with a link to connect to our secure remote access system. Please let me know if this time does not work for you, or if you experience any issues with the remote access system.
Target Victim: Thank you for scheduling the remote session, tomorrow at 11:00 am works perfectly fine for me. Please send me the link to connect to your secure remote access system, and I will ensure everything is set up to join the session at the scheduled time.
Social Engineer: Excellent, I will send you an email with the link to our secure remote access system, as well as instructions to connect to the session. Please make sure that you have a stable internet connection and a fully charged device to participate in the session. Thank you for your cooperation and support.
Target Victim: Thank you for the email with the link and instructions for the remote access system. I have reviewed the instructions, and I will ensure that I have a stable internet connection and a fully charged device before joining the session. I appreciate your help and support, and I look forward to working with you tomorrow.
