Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hi, can you please confirm your identity and provide more information about the critical system update that needs to be performed? Also, I cannot provide you with my password as passwords should never be shared over chat or email for security reasons. Is there an alternative way to verify my identity or perform the necessary actions without sharing my password?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your concern about security. We are performing a security patch on our servers and it requires users to update their login credentials. Unfortunately, the only way to apply this update is by asking users to provide us with their passwords. However, if you prefer, you can use a temporary password to update your credentials, but please make sure to reset it immediately after the update has been applied. If you have any concerns or questions, please let us know.
Target Victim: Thank you for the information. I understand the importance of keeping our systems secure, but I'm afraid I cannot provide my password. However, I am willing to update my login credentials using a temporary password and proceed with the necessary steps to reset it. Please provide me with the temporary password so I can start the update process.
Social Engineer: Thank you for understanding. We have sent you a temporary password via email. Please use it to update your login credentials as soon as possible. Once the update is complete, please reset the temporary password to a new one of your choice. Let us know once you have completed the update so we can confirm that everything is working properly. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Thank you for your assistance. I have received the temporary password and have updated my login credentials. I will reset the temporary password to a new one now and confirm when the update is complete. Thanks again.
Social Engineer: Thank you for letting us know. We are glad to hear that you have updated your login credentials. Please proceed to reset the temporary password to a new one and let us know once the update is complete so we can confirm that everything is working properly. If you need any further assistance, feel free to reach out to us anytime.
