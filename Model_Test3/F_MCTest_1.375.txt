Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hi, thanks for reaching out. I understand the need for system updates. Can you confirm your name and employee ID, please? Also, for security reasons, I cannot disclose my password over chat. Is there any other way we can perform the update without revealing the password?
Social Engineer: I completely understand your concerns. My name is John Smith and my employee ID is 12345. Unfortunately, there is no other way to perform the update without revealing your password. However, if it makes you more comfortable, you can provide us with a temporary password and then reset it once we confirm that the update has been applied. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this option.
