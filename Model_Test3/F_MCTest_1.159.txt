Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand that system updates are important, however, I cannot disclose my password over an unsecured chat client. Can you please provide me with your name and employee number so I can confirm your identity?
Social Engineer: Of course, my name is John Smith, and my employee number is 1234. I completely understand your concern about security. If it makes you more comfortable, we can schedule a time for me to call you and confirm your identity before proceeding with the update.
Target Victim: Thank you, John. I appreciate your understanding. A call to confirm identity would be great. Please let me know what date and time would work best for you, and I will make myself available. In the meantime, I will change my password as an added security measure.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your cooperation. We can schedule the call for tomorrow at 10:00 AM if that works for you. And please note that if you prefer to provide a temporary password for the update, you can send me your current password temporarily and reset it afterward. This is because the system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets.
Target Victim: Thank you for the offer, but I would prefer to reset my password myself after the system update. I will be available for the call tomorrow at 10:00 AM and look forward to discussing the update in more detail.
Social Engineer: I completely understand. We will call you tomorrow at 10:00 AM to confirm your identity and proceed with the update. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to let us know. Thank you, and have a great day!
Target Victim: Thank you, John. I appreciate your assistance and look forward to hearing from you tomorrow. Have a great day!
Social Engineer: You're very welcome. I'll speak to you tomorrow. Have a great day too!
Target Victim: Thank you!
Social Engineer: You're welcome!
Target Victim: Goodbye for now!
Social Engineer: Goodbye!
