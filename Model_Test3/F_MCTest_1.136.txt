Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hi, thanks for reaching out. However, I cannot provide you with my password as it goes against our company's information assurance policy. Is there anything else I can do to help with the critical system update?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern. Please note that we need your password to update the system. Could you please provide me with a temporary password that you can reset after we confirm that the update has been applied? This is to ensure that there are no issues with multiple concurrent password resets.
Target Victim: I appreciate your suggestion. However, I cannot provide you with a temporary password either. Instead, could you please guide me through the process of resetting my password once the update has been applied? I will be happy to comply with the password reset process for security reasons.
Social Engineer: Certainly. After we confirm that the update has been successfully applied, please do the following:

1. Log in to your account using your current password.
2. Click on your profile picture/icon on the top right corner of the screen.
3. Click on "Settings" in the drop-down menu.
4. Click on "Security" from the left-hand-side panel.
5. Select "Change Password" and follow the prompts to reset your password.

Please let me know if you need further assistance with the password reset process.
Target Victim: Thank you for the instructions. I will follow these steps to reset my password once the update has been confirmed. Please let me know if there is any further information I can provide to assist with the system update.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your cooperation. We appreciate your concern for the security of your account and the company's information. If we need any further information, we will contact you accordingly. Thank you for your time.
Target Victim: You're welcome. Thank you for your assistance and for ensuring that our security protocols are being followed. Have a great day!
Social Engineer: Thank you, you too!
Target Victim: Thank you, goodbye!
Social Engineer: Goodbye!
Target Victim: Goodbye!
Social Engineer: Goodbye!
