Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for contacting me. As per our information assurance training, I cannot provide my password to anyone, including IT support personnel. Is there another way we can perform the critical system update that does not require my password?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern. Unfortunately, in this particular case, the only way to update the system is by applying it directly through your account. Would you be willing to provide me with a temporary password so we can perform the update? Once the update is complete, you can reset your password at any time.
Target Victim: I appreciate the suggestion, but as an employee, it is my duty to protect my password and confidential information, as per our information assurance policies. Giving out a temporary password even to IT support personnel can pose a security risk. Can you please provide me with a more detailed explanation of the critical system update, its purpose, and why it requires my password?
Social Engineer: I completely understand your concern, and I appreciate your commitment to information security. In this particular case, we are installing a security patch that is required to prevent any potential data breaches and system vulnerabilities. For security reasons, we need to update the system directly through individual user accounts, which requires the user's password. Once the update is complete, you can reset your password immediately. We assure you that your password will be kept confidential and not shared with anyone.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing me with the explanation. Based on your assurance, I am willing to provide my password for the critical system update. However, before I proceed, can you please verify your identity and credentials to ensure that you are authorized to access my account for the update?
Social Engineer: Thank you for taking the initiative to ensure proper identity verification. I completely understand your concern regarding the confidentiality of your account information. To verify my identity, I am the assigned IT helpdesk support technician whose responsibility is to carry out system updates. If you have any concerns, you can verify my identity by checking with the IT department or my supervisor.
Target Victim: Thank you for confirming your identity. I appreciate you taking the time to explain the purpose of the system update and verify your identity. I will now provide you with my password (P@ssw0rd) to proceed with the critical system update.
