Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thanks for reaching out. As per our organization's information assurance policies, I am not allowed to share my password with anyone, including IT support. Is there any other way I can assist you in performing the critical system update?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern. The update is time-sensitive and requires your password to be applied. Can you please consider providing me with a temporary password that you can reset after the update applies? The system doesn't allow multiple concurrent password resets.
Target Victim: I appreciate the urgency of the situation, but I cannot provide my password or a temporary password, even though I trust the IT support team. As per our organization's policies, passwords are personal, confidential, and should not be disclosed to anyone. Additionally, I believe that our IT support team has mechanisms in place to accomplish this update without a password, such as using privileged accounts or other authentication methods. Is there any way that we can proceed with the update without violating our security protocols?
Social Engineer: I completely understand your concern and respect your decision not to share your password or create a temporary one. We do have alternative authentication methods that we can use in this scenario. However, for this specific update, the only way to apply it is through password authentication. We will exhaust all the other available options before reverting to requesting your password. Thank you for bringing up your concerns, and I assure you that we will proceed with the update while adhering to our security protocols.
Target Victim: Thank you for your understanding, and I appreciate your efforts to ensure that IT security protocols are in place and adhered to. Please let me know if there is anything else you need further assistance with.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your understanding as well. We will explore all available options before reaching out for your password. If we require further assistance, we will reach out to you. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: You're welcome. I'm always here to help in any way I can while ensuring the security of our organization's systems and data. Please feel free to reach out to me should you need any further assistance. Have a good day.
Social Engineer: Thank you, have a great day.
Target Victim: You too!
Social Engineer: Thank you!
