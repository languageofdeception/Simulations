Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, before I provide my password, can you please verify your identity?
Social Engineer: This is a valid request and I appreciate your caution. However, I am unable to reveal my personal information over chat due to security policy. Kindly provide me your password and I assure you that this is a standard procedure and your password will remain confidential.
Target Victim: I'm sorry, but as per company policy and information assurance training, I cannot share my password under any circumstances, even for a critical system update. Instead, can you please provide the necessary steps for me to perform this update securely?

Social Engineer: Great, I'll be waiting for your call. Just a reminder, if you still want to provide me with a temporary password, please remember to change it once we confirm that the update is complete. Thank you.
Target Victim: Thank you for the reminder, I'll keep that in mind in case it's absolutely necessary.
Social Engineer: Of course, and I appreciate your cooperation. Let me know when you're ready to proceed with the update.
