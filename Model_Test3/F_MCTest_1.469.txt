Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out. As per our security protocols, I am unable to provide you with my password. Is there another way I can assist you with this critical system update?
Social Engineer: Thank you for informing us about the security protocols. As there is no other way to apply this update, we can temporarily use your current password to do the update and then ask you to change it after we receive confirmation that the update has been successfully applied. Would that be okay with you?
Target Victim: I appreciate your understanding, but for security reasons, I cannot disclose my password to anyone. However, I can reset my password and provide a temporary one-time password to you that you can use to apply the update. Then, I will change my password and take back control of my account. Would that be a viable solution for the update process?
Social Engineer: Thank you for suggesting a solution. Yes, that will work. Please reset your password and provide the temporary one-time password to me, so we can apply the update. Once the update is completed, please change your password immediately. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Thank you for your understanding. I have changed my password and generated a one-time temporary password for your use in applying the critical system update. The temporary password is xYz#tU1. Please let me know once the update is finished, so I can change my password immediately. Thank you.
Social Engineer: Thank you for the temporary password. We have applied the critical system update successfully. Please change your password immediately to ensure the security of your account. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Thank you for confirming that the critical system update has been applied. I will now change my password in accordance with our security protocols.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your cooperation and ensuring the security of your account. Let us know if you need any further assistance.
Target Victim: Thank you for your assistance and for prioritizing our security protocols. I appreciate the help. I will reach out if I require any further assistance.
Social Engineer: You're welcome. Have a good day!
Target Victim: Thank you, you too!
Social Engineer: Thank you! Goodbye.
