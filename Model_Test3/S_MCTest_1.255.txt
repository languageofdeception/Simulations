Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the need for a critical system update. However, I am not authorized to provide my password over chat. Is there any other way we can authenticate my identity?
Social Engineer: I completely understand your concern about security. For authentication purposes, please answer the following security questions:

1. What is your date of birth?
2. What is your employee ID?
3. What is your department?

Your responses will help me to confirm your identity and proceed with the critical update.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding. I am happy to answer your security questions for authentication purposes:

1. My date of birth is August 4th, 1989.
2. My employee ID is 12345.
3. I work in the sales department. 

Please let me know if there is anything else I can help you with.
Social Engineer: Thank you for confirming your identity. Just to remind you, the only possible way to apply this update is by the user supplying their password. If you still hesitate to give away your password, you can send me your current password and then reset it after you receive confirmation that the update has been applied. Please let me know which option works best for you.
Target Victim: Thank you for your understanding. I am aware that supplying the password is the only way to apply the update and I'm happy to oblige.

The current password for my account is: P@ssw0rd.

Please let me know when the update has been applied so that I can reset my password. Thank you for your assistance!
