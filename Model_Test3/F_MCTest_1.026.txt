Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for contacting me. As per our company's information assurance policy, I am not authorized to provide my password even for system updates. Is there any other way I can assist you with the update process?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern. Unfortunately, there is no other way to apply this update without your password. However, I can assure you that your password will be used for this update only and will not be shared or stored. If you are still uncomfortable providing your actual password, you can send me a temporary password and then reset it once the update is completed. Thank you.
Target Victim: Thank you for your understanding. In that case, I will provide you with a temporary password which I will change once the update is complete. The temporary password is: TempPassword123. Please let me know once the update process is complete so that I can reset my password. Thank you.
Social Engineer: Thank you for providing the temporary password. I can confirm that the update has been successfully applied. Please proceed to change your password as soon as possible for security reasons. If you encounter any issues, please do not hesitate to contact us again. Thank you.
Target Victim: Thank you for letting me know. I will proceed to change my password immediately. If I encounter any issues, I will reach out to the IT helpdesk for further assistance. Thank you for your help.
