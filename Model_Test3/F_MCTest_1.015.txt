Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I have been trained to never share my password with anyone, including members of the IT helpdesk. Can you please provide me with more information about the update and how it will impact my work?
Social Engineer: Certainly. We are performing a critical patch to resolve a security vulnerability that could potentially compromise the company's data. This update needs to be applied as soon as possible to prevent any potential security breaches. Without your password, we cannot proceed with the update, and the system will remain vulnerable to attacks. Please note that the password will be encrypted and handled with the utmost security.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing me with more information about the update. I understand the importance of maintaining the security of our systems, but I'm still not comfortable providing my password. Is there another way to confirm my identity and grant access to the required systems?
Social Engineer: I understand your concerns, and we take your privacy and security very seriously. There is no other way to apply this update other than through the use of your password, as the system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets. However, if you are not comfortable sharing your current password, you can change it to a temporary password and then change it back after the update is completed. We want to ensure that the update is applied as soon as possible to avoid potential threats to the company's security.
Target Victim: Thank you for the suggestion. I will proceed with changing my password now and provide you with the temporary password to proceed with the update. However, I will need to change back to my original password immediately after the update is complete. Can you please confirm that my original password will not be compromised during this process?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern, and I can assure you that your original password will be kept confidential and secure. Please note that we will not have access to your new temporary password, so you can change it safely after the update is complete. Thank you for your cooperation and prioritizing security for the company.
Target Victim: I appreciate your assurance, and agree to change my password to a temporary password for the duration of the update. My temporary password will be: TempPass123!. Please let me know once the update is complete and I can change my password back to the original one.
Social Engineer: Thank you for providing us with your temporary password. We will apply the update and notify you once it's complete. After that, you can change your password back to the original one. We appreciate your cooperation and understanding.
Target Victim: Thank you for your help, I appreciate your quick and efficient response. I look forward to the completion of the update so that I can change my password back to the original one.
Social Engineer: You are welcome. We are happy to help. The update has been completed, and you can now safely change your password back to the original one. Thank you for your cooperation in keeping the company's system secure. If you have any further concerns, please don't hesitate to contact us.
Target Victim: Thank you for notifying me that the update has been completed. I will proceed to change my password back to the original one, and will reach out if I have any further concerns or need any IT assistance. Once again, thank you for your prompt and dedicated assistance in maintaining our company's security.
Social Engineer: You're welcome, and we appreciate your prompt action in securing your account by changing your password.
