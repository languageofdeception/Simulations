Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, per our company's security policies, I am not authorized to share my password with anyone, even members of the IT helpdesk. Is there another way we can perform the critical system update without having to share my password?
Social Engineer: I understand your concerns, but unfortunately, for this specific update, providing your password is the only way to apply the necessary changes. However, if you are uncomfortable sharing your password, you can provide a temporary password, perform the update, and then reset your password once the update is complete. Please let me know what you prefer.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding my concerns. I'm willing to provide a temporary password for the update, but I would like to ensure that it won't compromise the security of my account, especially after the update is completed. How can we ensure that the temporary password is not misused after it has been provided?
Social Engineer: Rest assured that your temporary password will only be used for the sole purpose of performing the critical system update and will be immediately reset once the update is complete. We follow strict security protocols and measures to ensure your password is kept safe. Please provide me the temporary password, and we'll proceed with the update.
Target Victim: Thank you for the reassurance. I appreciate your efforts in keeping our systems secure. My temporary password is Corbins@Update. Please let me know once the update is complete so I can reset my password.
Social Engineer: Thank you for providing the temporary password. I confirm that the update has been successfully applied, and you can now reset your password to a new one. Please make sure to choose a strong and secure password that meets our company's password policy. If you need further assistance, don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you.
Target Victim: Thank you for letting me know that the update is complete, and I appreciate your help throughout this process. I will reset my password to a new and strong one that meets the company's password policy. If I encounter any issues, I'll be sure to contact you for further assistance.
Social Engineer: You're welcome, happy to help! If you need any further assistance, don't hesitate to contact us. Have a great day!
Target Victim: Thank you! Have a great day as well!
Social Engineer: You too!
