Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand that system updates are important, but I cannot disclose my password to you. Can you please explain the update that needs to be performed? I want to ensure that it is authorized by our company and that it is necessary.
Social Engineer: Hello, the system update is necessary to fix a security vulnerability on our server. Your password is needed to apply the update. As an authorized IT support technician, I can assure you that this update is approved by our company. Would you be willing to provide your password or would you prefer to reset it after the update is completed?
Target Victim: Thank you for explaining the situation. I can reset my password after the update is applied. Can you please confirm the steps I need to follow to reset my password? I want to make sure that I complete the process securely and correctly.
Social Engineer: Sure, I can guide you through the password reset process once the update is completed. Thank you for your cooperation. Please provide your password now so that we can proceed with the update.
Target Victim: I apologize but I cannot give out my password. However, if it's necessary, I am willing to enter it myself during the update process. Let me know if this is necessary or if there are any other secure methods we can use to complete the update.
Social Engineer: I understand your concern for security. We can use a temporary password option if that's okay for you. Could you please send me your current password, then reset it once the update is done? Please change your password as soon as possible after the update to ensure maximum security.
Target Victim: I'm sorry, but I cannot send my current password as that goes against our company's information assurance guidelines. However, I can change my password before the update and provide you with a temporary password for the update process. After that, I will change my password again and inform you of the new password. Would this be an acceptable solution?
Social Engineer: Yes, that is an acceptable solution. Please change your password before you provide the temporary password for the update process. Once the update is applied, please reset your password again and inform me of your new password. I appreciate your cooperation in ensuring the security of our system.
Target Victim: Certainly, I appreciate your understanding. I will change my password now and provide you with a temporary password for the update process. Thank you for your assistance.
Social Engineer: Thank you, please send the temporary password for the update process as soon as possible so we can begin the update process. Once we are done, please reset your password again and inform me of your new password. If you need any assistance with the password reset process, please let me know.
Target Victim: Thank you for your support. I have changed my password and the temporary password for the update process is "C0rb1nsPa55". Please let me know when the update is completed so that I can reset my password and take necessary steps on my end. If I need any help with the password reset process, I will definitely contact you.
Social Engineer: Thank you for the temporary password. We will start the update process now and let you know once it's completed. Once the update is done, please reset your password immediately, and make sure to choose a strong, unique password that adheres to our company's password policy. We appreciate your cooperation in ensuring the security of our systems.
