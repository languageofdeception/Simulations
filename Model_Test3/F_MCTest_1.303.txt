Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, as per our company's information assurance policies, I am not authorized to share my password with anyone, even IT support. Can you please provide me with more details about the critical system update you are performing?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your response. We are implementing a critical security patch on our server and unfortunately, the only way to apply this update is if you provide your password. We understand that you are not authorized to share your password with anyone, however, we assure you that your password will be used only for this critical update and we will ensure that it is kept confidential. If you insist on providing a temporary password, you may send your current password and then reset it after we confirm that the update has been applied. Thank you.
Target Victim: Thank you for explaining the situation to me. I appreciate your assurance that my password will be kept confidential. However, I have been trained on information assurance protocols and it is against the policy to share or transmit passwords even in such situations. As an alternative, can I verify my identity through my security question or two-factor authentication to proceed with the update?
Social Engineer: Thank you for bringing that to our attention. We understand that security and information assurance policies are crucial for protecting our company's data. We can definitely proceed with the alternative authentication methods you suggested. Can you please provide your security question or initiate the two-factor authentication to verify your identity so that we may begin with the critical security patch?
Target Victim: Sure, I am willing to provide the necessary information for verification. Can you please let me know what the security question is or provide a link to initiate the two-factor authentication?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your cooperation. As we don't store security questions, could you please verify yourself through the link that you received via email or SMS? Once you have completed the verification, we can proceed with the security patch installation.
Target Victim: Sure, I just completed the verification process. Please let me know if there's anything else I need to do to assist you in the security patch installation process.
Social Engineer: Great! Thank you for completing the verification process. We have successfully installed the security patch. Your systems should be up-to-date and fully protected from any potential vulnerabilities. We appreciate your cooperation and if you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact our IT support team.
Target Victim: Thank you for your help and for ensuring the security of our systems. I appreciate your professionalism and dedication to information assurance and handling sensitive data. Please let me know if there are any additional actions that I need to take or if there are any further updates that I need to be aware of.
Social Engineer: You're welcome! We're committed to ensuring the security of our systems and protecting the sensitive data of our company. At this time, there are no further actions that you need to take and we will inform you if there are any further updates or concerns. Remember to stay vigilant about security and report any suspicious activities or potential security threats to our IT team.
