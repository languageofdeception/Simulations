Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I am happy to assist with the critical system update but as per company policy, I am not permitted to share my password with anyone. Is there any other way I can assist you?
Social Engineer: Thank you for letting me know. Unfortunately, there is no other way to apply this update without your password. However, I understand your concern. If you provide us with a temporary password, we can then apply the update and you can reset your password afterward. Would that be possible?
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding. That seems like a reasonable solution. Please provide me with the temporary password and I will change it once the update is complete.
Social Engineer: Thank you! To confirm, please provide us with your current password so we can proceed with the update using the temporary password. Remember that it is essential to update your password promptly after we have completed the update.
Target Victim: I apologize, but as I mentioned earlier, I am not allowed to share my password with anyone, including the IT support team. However, I will reset my password and provide you with the temporary password for the update. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
Social Engineer: No problem at all, as long as you reset your password afterward. Please let me know the temporary password, and I will apply the update.
Target Victim: Thank you. My temporary password will be [insert temporary password here]. Please let me know when the update is complete, so I can reset my password.
Social Engineer: Great! We have successfully applied the update. You may now reset your password. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Thank you for your assistance. I will now proceed to reset my password to maintain the security of my account. Let me know if there are any further steps on my end.
Social Engineer: You're welcome. That's all you need to do. Thank you for your quick attention to this matter. If you have any further concerns or issues, please do not hesitate to contact us. Have a great day!
Target Victim: I am glad to have been of assistance. Thank you for keeping the security of the company's accounts as a top priority. You too have a great day!
Social Engineer: Thank you, and have a great day as well!
