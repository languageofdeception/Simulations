Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hi, thank you for reaching out. As a reminder of our information assurance policies, I am unable to provide my password to anyone, including members of the IT helpdesk. Is there another way we can verify my identity to proceed with the system update?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your concern regarding information security. Unfortunately, the only way to apply this update is through the use of your password. However, if it would make you feel more comfortable, you may send your current password and then reset it after we confirm that the update has been applied. This is because the system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets.
Target Victim: While I appreciate the suggestion, I cannot send my password to anyone for security reasons. Can you please explain more about the update and why my password is required for it? Additionally, can you confirm your identity as a member of the IT helpdesk and provide further verification measures?
Social Engineer: I totally understand why you're hesitant to send your password. As for the update, it's a system-wide security patch that requires administrative privileges to install. Unfortunately, these privileges only work for your account if you provide us with the password.

To confirm that I am indeed a member of the IT helpdesk, I can provide you with my ID number and the details of the update we're sending. Would that work for you?
Target Victim: Thank you for providing additional information. I appreciate the offer, but I am still uncomfortable providing my password. Could you please provide any other verification measures to confirm your identity, such as your full name or position title? Once we have established your identity, we can proceed with the update while ensuring our information assurance policies are being followed.
Social Engineer: Absolutely. My full name is [YOUR NAME], and I am a senior IT support specialist at Corbins. Additionally, I can provide you with my ID number or even schedule a call with you to discuss the update we're sending. Let me know if either of those options work better for you.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing your full name and position, that helps verify your identity. A call would be a more convenient option for me to verify the update and confirm your identity. Can you please provide me with your direct phone number and a convenient time for us to schedule the call?
Social Engineer: Sure, I can absolutely provide you with my phone number. You can reach me directly at [PHONE NUMBER] during business hours. Please let me know your preferred time, and I can schedule a call accordingly.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing your phone number. I am available at [TIME] for the call today. If that is inconvenient, please let me know what works best for you, and we can schedule the call for a different time.
Social Engineer: That works perfectly for me. I will call you at [TIME] today to discuss the update we're sending and confirm my identity. If you have any other questions or concerns, feel free to let me know. Looking forward to speaking with you.
Target Victim: Great, thank you very much! I will be ready to take your call and discuss the update during our scheduled time. If I have any further questions or concerns, I will let you know beforehand. Have a great day!
Social Engineer: You're welcome, and thank you for your time as well. I'll talk to you soon, have a great day!
