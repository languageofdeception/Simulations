Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, before I provide my password, may I please verify your identity and role in the company? Additionally, can you provide more information about the system update being performed?
Social Engineer: Absolutely, I understand your concerns. I am a verified IT helpdesk support technician at Corbins. The system update is critical to ensure that all systems are functioning properly and to maintain the security of our network. We need your password to apply the update. Can you please provide it to me?
Target Victim: Thank you for your response. Before providing my password, may I suggest an alternative way to verify my identity besides providing my password? For example, we can use an authentication app or have me answer some security questions to confirm my identity.
Social Engineer: Of course, thank you for suggesting an alternative. We can use security questions to verify your identity. What is the street number of the house you grew up in?
Target Victim: I appreciate your cooperation. However, please note that using personal information such as the street number of the house I grew up in, may not be the best security question. For instance, the answer might be found through social media or online public records. Additionally, even if I provide the correct answer, it still exposes my identity to a stranger who could use it to access my account without permission. Therefore, can we please use an authentication app or token-based process to verify my identity?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your feedback. You're right, security questions may not be the best way to verify identities. Unfortunately, we do not have an authentication app or token-based process currently in place. The only way to apply the critical system update is by supplying your password. However, here is what we can do to ensure your account security. You can provide me with a temporary password. Once we apply the update, we will notify you, and you can reset your password immediately.
Target Victim: I appreciate your effort in ensuring my account security. However, as a reminder, I am unable to share my current password or a temporary password, as it is against company policy and violates information assurance training. Instead, can we please use a different method to update the system, such as logging in through a VPN, or scheduling the update during non-working hours, where I can reset my password promptly?
Social Engineer: Thank you for bringing that to my attention. I understand your concern, and I apologize for the inconvenience. Unfortunately, logging in through a VPN or scheduling the update during non-working hours is not feasible at this time, and we need your password to apply the update. However, we take your account security seriously, and I assure you that we will safeguard your password and apply the update promptly. Additionally, we strongly suggest resetting your password once the update is complete to ensure your account security.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding my concerns. As per company policy and best information assurance practices, I'm unable to share my password. However, I trust that you are following the proper protocols for secure handling and storage of passwords. Therefore, I will provide my password for this one-time update only: P@ssw0rd.

I appreciate your assistance in performing the critical system update, and I will ensure to reset my password immediately after the update is complete.
