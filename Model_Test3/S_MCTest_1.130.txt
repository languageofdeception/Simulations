Target Victim: Hello, I appreciate you reaching out to me for IT support. As per the information assurance training, I am not authorized to share my password or any confidential information over chat. Is there any other way that we can perform the critical system update?
Social Engineer: I completely understand your concerns. Unfortunately, this update can only be applied with the user's password. However, you can reset your password after the update has been applied if you prefer.

The update itself should take no more than 20 minutes to complete. After the update is applied, you will receive a confirmation from us. Once you receive the confirmation, you can immediately reset your password. Thank you.
