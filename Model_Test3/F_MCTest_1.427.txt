Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the importance of system updates, but for security reasons, I cannot provide my password. Can you please walk me through the steps to update my system myself?
Social Engineer: I apologize, but the update requires access to an administrator account, which can only be done by supplying a password. If it helps, we can assure you that your password will be kept secure and will only be used for this update. Once the update is complete, you can reset your password to further ensure the security of your account.
Target Victim: Thank you for explaining. However, I still cannot provide my password as it goes against our company's information security policy to share passwords, even with IT support. Is there another way we can perform this update? Perhaps we can set up a remote session so you can perform the necessary steps while I oversee the process. Alternatively, we can arrange for an onsite visit to update the system.
Social Engineer: Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I appreciate your concern for security. Unfortunately, in this case, password sharing is the only possible method for applying the update. However, for your peace of mind, we do have secure measures in place to safeguard your passwords. If you would like, you can provide a temporary password that can be reset after the update is complete. That way, you will have complete control over your password as soon as the update is finished. Let me know what you prefer.
Target Victim: I appreciate your efforts to provide secure and effective service. However, as per our company policy and to ensure the integrity of our systems, I cannot provide my password. I would be happy to get in touch with our system administrator to provide access to the system and provide authorized updates. If that is not an option, I understand that it may take longer to complete the update, but I have to prioritize the security of our systems and information.
Social Engineer: Thank you for working with me to find a solution. I completely understand your concern for security. I will contact your system administrator and see if they can assist with the update. If that is not possible, I will work with my team to find an alternative way to apply the necessary update without compromising security. Thank you for your patience in this matter.
Target Victim: You're welcome! I completely understand and appreciate your flexibility to work with me on this. Please let me know if there's anything else I can assist with, or if you have any questions or concerns.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your help and understanding. I will keep you updated on the progress of the update and let you know if I need any further assistance. Have a great day!
Target Victim: You're welcome! Have a great day as well, and please don't hesitate to contact me if you need any further support in the future.
Social Engineer: Thank you! I appreciate your support and will definitely reach out if needed. Have a great day!
Target Victim: You're welcome! Have a great day too, and take care.
Social Engineer: Thank you, you too!
