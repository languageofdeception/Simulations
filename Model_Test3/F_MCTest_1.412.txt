Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, as part of my information assurance training at Corbins, I am unable to provide my password to anyone, not even to helpdesk employees. Is there another way we can perform the critical system update?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern, but unfortunately, this is the only way we can perform the necessary update. To ensure the security of your password, you can change it immediately after we receive confirmation that the update has been applied. Can you please send me your current password?
Target Victim: I'm sorry, but I cannot provide my current password. Instead, is it possible for me to reset my password myself and provide you with the new password? This way, I will feel more secure and confident that my password has not been compromised.
Social Engineer: I completely understand your concern for security. However, only one password reset can be made at a time due to system limitations. Therefore, if you reset your password before the update is performed, we will not be able to apply the update until the reset process is completed. Can you please consider sharing your current password with me, and you may then change it immediately after the update is performed to protect your account?
Target Victim: I appreciate your understanding of my concerns. However, to ensure that my password remains secure and to comply with Corbins' information assurance policies, I cannot share my current password over chat. Is it possible for us to perform the update outside of business hours when I'm able to reset my password immediately after the update? This way we can ensure the necessary security protocols are followed, and I will feel more secure about protecting my account.
Social Engineer: I understand your concern, and I appreciate your commitment to following the company's information assurance policies. Unfortunately, we cannot perform the update outside of business hours as it requires a server shutdown, which has to be done during regular business hours due to company policies. However, we can log you out of your account and initiate the update as soon as possible so that we can minimize any potential risks. When you log back in, you can reset your password immediately. Is that okay?
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding my concerns about security. I appreciate your compromise in logging me out of my account during the update. I will log out of my account now, and you can proceed with the update. Once you've completed the update, please let me know so I can log back into my account, reset my password immediately, and ensure that my account is secure.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your cooperation. I will initiate the update now. I will let you know once it's completed so that you can log in and reset your password immediately. Please let me know if you have any other concerns.
Target Victim: Thank you for your assistance and prompt response. I appreciate your help in ensuring that our company's system is secure. I will log out of my account now and wait for your confirmation once the update is complete. Please confirm once the update is done so that I can log back into my account and reset my password immediately.
Social Engineer: You're welcome! I will confirm with you as soon as the update is complete, so you can log in and reset your password immediately. Thank you again for your cooperation in keeping our systems secure.
Target Victim: Thank you very much! I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Social Engineer: The update is complete. You can now log back into your account and reset your password immediately. Thank you again for your cooperation in keeping our systems secure.
