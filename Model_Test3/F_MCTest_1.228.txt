Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I would be happy to proceed with the critical system update. However, I cannot provide my password for security reasons. Is there any other way to verify my identity or complete the update without disclosing the password?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your concern about security. Unfortunately, the system requires your password to apply the critical update. However, you can provide a temporary password, apply the update, and then change your password afterward. This will ensure maximum security.
Target Victim: I appreciate your suggestion, but disclosing any form of my password is against the company's information assurance policies. Is there any other way to complete the critical update without sharing specific login information? Additionally, can you please provide more details about the update and its urgency?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern. Unfortunately, at this time, supplying your password is the only way to perform the update. The update is critical as it resolves a security vulnerability impacting the entire company. Please let us know if you have any other questions or concerns.
Target Victim: Thank you for the prompt response. I understand the urgency of the update and appreciate your diligence in protecting the company's security. To verify my identity, can I provide some personally identifiable information such as my employee ID or birth date to proceed with the update?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your suggestion, but we have to follow the standard policy, which requires authentication using the individual's password. However, I suggest you change your password after we have applied the critical update. Please let me know if you have any other concerns or questions.
Target Victim: I understand your requirement, but I am still unable to disclose my specific login information. However, I am willing to reset my password temporarily, and you can provide me with an authentication code that I can use during the update process. Using this code, I can reset my password after the update is complete. Would this option be possible?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your suggestion. That sounds like an excellent compromise, and we can proceed with that option. I will provide an authentication code once we start the update process. Thanks again for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Thank you for your understanding, and I appreciate you providing a solution that respects our information assurance policies. I am ready to proceed with the update now.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your cooperation. I have sent you an authentication code, please use this code to reset your password temporarily. Once the update is complete, please change your password again for security purposes. The system update should take approximately 30 minutes to complete, and we will inform you once it's done. Thank you.
Target Victim: Thank you. I have received the authentication code, and I'll use it to reset my password temporarily. I'll be sure to change it again for security purposes after the update has been completed. Thank you for your help with the system update.
Social Engineer: You're welcome. Thank you for your cooperation and for helping us ensure the security of our systems. Please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any other IT-related concerns or issues in the future.
