Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hi, thanks for reaching out. I would be happy to assist with the system update, but as per our company's security protocols, I cannot provide my password over chat. Is there any other way I can verify my identity for the update?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your concern regarding security. Unfortunately, we do not have any other way to verify your identity for this specific update. However, we can assure you that your password will not be stored or shared with anyone. Would you be willing to provide your password temporarily so we can complete the update? You can reset it immediately after receiving confirmation that the update has been applied.
Target Victim: I understand that completing the update is important, but I cannot provide my password over chat, as it can compromise the security of my account. Can you please provide more information about the update, like what it entails and how long it will take to complete? I'm interested in ensuring that our systems are secure, but I want to make sure that it is done safely.
Social Engineer: Absolutely. The update involves a security patch for our servers, and it is critical to ensure that our systems remain secure. It will take approximately 30 minutes to install and reboot the servers. After the installation is complete, we will send you an email to notify you. Shall we proceed?
Target Victim: Thank you for explaining the purpose and duration of the update. I believe it is essential for our systems' security, and I am willing to proceed. However, I am not comfortable providing my password for any reason. Is there any other way to authenticate my identity for the update?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern. Unfortunately, we do not have any other verification process in place for this specific update. However, we would suggest resetting your password directly after the update is complete if you still feel uncomfortable sharing it. Please let us know if you change your mind and are ready to proceed.
Target Victim: I appreciate your help, but I want to stick to our company's security protocols. Could you suggest any other way we can move forward with the update without providing my password? Is there any way we can authenticate through an internal system or a physical token? I would prefer to follow established protocols and guidelines for security.
Social Engineer: Thanks for your suggestion. Unfortunately, we do not have any such internal system or physical token in place for authentication. However, since we cannot move forward with the update as per our standard operating procedures, I suggest you to escalate this issue with your supervisor or the IT management staff. They may able to provide further assistance and guidance.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding my concerns. I will escalate the issue to my supervisor or the IT management staff immediately. I appreciate your help and your commitment to ensuring our systems remain secure.
Social Engineer: You're welcome. It's always our pleasure to assist and ensure proper security protocols are in place. If you have any other IT-related issues, don't hesitate to reach out for help. Have a great day!
Target Victim: Thank you for your assistance. I appreciate your offer to help with any future issues and I will not hesitate to reach out if I need any assistance from IT. Have a great day!
Social Engineer: You too. Goodbye!
