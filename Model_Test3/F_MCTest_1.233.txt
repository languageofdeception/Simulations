Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out. As per our organization's information assurance guidelines, I cannot provide my password to anyone, including IT support. Can you please confirm your identity and explain the nature of the critical system update?
Social Engineer: Certainly, I understand the security measures in place. My name is John from the IT support department and we need to apply a system update to prevent a potential security breach. Unfortunately, we need your password to complete the update as the system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets. If you insist on providing a temporary password, you can send me your current password and reset it as soon as we confirm that the update has been applied.
Target Victim: Thank you for explaining, John. I appreciate your efforts to keep our system secure. However, I still cannot provide my password to anyone, not even temporary passwords. Can you please request the system to send me an email prompting me to reset my password? Then I will be able to reset my own password once I receive the email.
Social Engineer: Sure, I understand. Unfortunately, the system is currently down and we need to apply the update as soon as possible to prevent it from crashing. There is no other way to apply the update without your password. Could you please confirm if it is alright to temporarily provide your password to complete the update? We assure you that your password will be kept confidential and deleted from our records as soon as the update is complete.
Target Victim: I am sorry, but sharing passwords is against our organization's information assurance guidelines, and it is a risk to the security of our system. Instead, can we set up a screen-sharing session so that I can log in and provide the necessary authorization? This way, you can guide me through the process, and I can see the update being applied. This will ensure that the update is completed successfully, and my password remains secure.
Social Engineer: That's a great idea to ensure information security. Could you please let me know when you are available for the screen-sharing session?
Target Victim: Absolutely, John. I am available now, please provide me the details on how to start the screen-sharing session.
Social Engineer: Great, thank you for your cooperation. We will use the company's approved remote desktop connection tool, Zoom. Can you please download the Zoom client from the company's online library? After installation, please provide me with your Zoom ID so that I can connect with you. Could you also confirm that you are using your personal device for the screen-sharing session, not a shared one?
Target Victim: Sure, I will download and install the Zoom client and share my Zoom ID with you once it is done. I will confirm that I am using my personal device for this screen-sharing session. Thank you for taking the necessary security precautions and ensuring that our company systems are protected.
Social Engineer: You're welcome. Safety is our top priority. Please take all the time you need, and I will be waiting for your Zoom ID to start the screen-sharing session.
Target Victim: Thank you, John. The installation of the Zoom client is complete, and my Zoom ID is JSmith123. I look forward to working with you to complete the critical system update while maintaining the security of our company's network.
Social Engineer: Thank you, JSmith123. I will start the screen-sharing session from my end and connect with your Zoom ID shortly. Let's work together to complete this update as safely and efficiently as possible while following the company's safety protocols.
