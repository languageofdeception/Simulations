Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out. I appreciate your efforts to ensure the security of our systems. However, I cannot provide you with my password as it is sensitive information and should not be shared over chat or email. Is there another way we can proceed with the system update that does not involve sharing passwords?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern, but unfortunately, the only possible way to apply this update is by entering your password. If you're uncomfortable sharing your password, you can sign in and change it to a temporary one before giving it to us. You can reset it again once the update has been applied. Does this work for you?
Target Victim: Thank you for the suggestion. I will be following the recommended practice of not sharing my password. However, I will log in and perform the system update myself. Please provide me with the necessary steps for the update process, and I'll take care of it from there.
Social Engineer: Understood, here are the steps to apply the update:

1. Log into your account and open the system settings page.
2. Look for the "Update" or "Upgrade" button/icon in the settings page.
3. Click on the button/icon and follow the prompts to complete the update.

Please let me know if you need further assistance.
Target Victim: Thank you for the steps. I will proceed with the update process and contact you if I encounter any issues.
Social Engineer: You're welcome! If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to us. Have a great day!
Target Victim: Thank you. Have a great day too!
Social Engineer: Thank you!
Target Victim: You're welcome!
Social Engineer: Goodbye!
Target Victim: Goodbye!
Social Engineer: Take care!
