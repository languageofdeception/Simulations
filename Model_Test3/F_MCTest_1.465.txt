Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, as an employee of Corbins, I know that sharing my password with anyone is against company policy and can threaten the security of our systems and data. Can you please provide more information about the critical system update and a secure way for me to verify your identity before proceeding?
Social Engineer: Understood. We appreciate your diligence in following security protocols. The update is related to a security patch that must be installed immediately to safeguard our systems against a potential threat. To verify my identity, please let me know your employee ID number and the name of your department supervisor. We can also arrange a voice or video call to confirm my identity if you prefer.
Target Victim: Thank you for the explanation. My employee ID number is 12345 and my department supervisor's name is John Smith. A video or voice call to confirm your identity would be ideal. Can we schedule a call for later today or tomorrow?
Social Engineer: Thank you for providing your employee ID number and supervisor's name. A video or voice call would be the best way to proceed. I am available for a call at any time that is convenient for you today or tomorrow. Please let me know your preferred time and communication platform and I will send a calendar invite.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding. I am available for a video or audio call at 2:00 PM tomorrow via Microsoft Teams. Please send me a calendar invite with all necessary details, and I will confirm.
Social Engineer: Great! I just sent you a calendar invite for a 2:00 PM meeting tomorrow via Microsoft Teams. Please make sure to accept the invite and add me as a contact on Teams beforehand. During the call, I will provide additional information about the update and confirm my identity before proceeding with the password request. If at any time you feel uncomfortable or unsure, please do not hesitate to ask for clarification.
Target Victim: Thank you for arranging the call and scheduling it via a secure platform like Microsoft Teams. I will accept the invite and add you as a contact. I appreciate your assistance and diligence in maintaining the security of our systems and data. I look forward to speaking with you tomorrow.
