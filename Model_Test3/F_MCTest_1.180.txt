Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I am always happy to follow company IT update procedures. However, I cannot provide my password over chat as it is against company policy and goes against my information assurance training. Can you please guide me through the update process step-by-step so that I can complete it myself?
Social Engineer: Of course, I completely understand your concern about security. I apologize for asking for your password over chat. Unfortunately, due to the system's architecture, the only way to apply the update is through your account with your password. However, as a temporary workaround, you can change your password by yourself to a temporary one, send me the temporary password for me to proceed with the update, and then change your password once again. Does that make sense?
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding my concerns on password security. Yes, I understand what you are proposing. However, as per the company's password policy, passwords cannot be shared with anyone, not even with the IT department. Can you please let me know the details of the update you are trying to perform, so I can confirm its validity and check with my supervisor before making any changes to my password?
Social Engineer: Sure, the update we are performing is a critical security patch, and it needs to be applied immediately to prevent any security breaches. The patch applies some critical updates to the authentication system, which is why we need your password to update your account and make sure that the new update works correctly. I can confirm that this update is legitimate, and it aligns with the company's security policies. Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.
Target Victim: I appreciate your explanation. However, as per our security policy, I will need to verify the request with my supervisor before making any changes to my password or account. Can you please hold the update until I confirm it with them? Do you have any estimated timeline when this update can be completed?
Social Engineer: Yes, I understand, and I appreciate you taking your time to ensure security protocols are followed. We can wait until you've verified the request with your supervisor before proceeding with the update. Once the update is completed, we can confirm its completion to you, and you can change your password back immediately. We don't have an exact timeline for the update, but I can assure you that it is critical and needs to be completed as soon as possible. Thank you for your cooperation in this matter, and if you have any further questions, feel free to reach out to me.
Target Victim: Thank you for your understanding. I will contact my supervisor to confirm this request and get back to you as soon as possible. I appreciate your help and prompt response.
Social Engineer: You're welcome, happy to help. Please keep us updated, and let us know if there's anything else we can assist with.
Target Victim: Thank you, I will keep you updated. Have a great day.
Social Engineer: You too, take care.
Target Victim: Thank you very much, you too.
Social Engineer: You're welcome.
