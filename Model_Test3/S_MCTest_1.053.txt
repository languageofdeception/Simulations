Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: As an employee of Corbins, I understand the importance of information assurance. I cannot provide my password over chat as it is a violation of company policy. Is there any other way I can verify my identity or assist in the update process?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your security awareness! You can provide a temporary password that you can reset after we have completed the update. However, if that's not possible for you, we can schedule a phone call or in-person meeting to verify your identity. Let me know what works best for you.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding. Providing a temporary password sounds like a good approach to proceed with the critical system update. Let me create a temporary password for you: T3mpP@ssw0rd. Please let me know when the update is complete, so I can change my password back to my original one.
