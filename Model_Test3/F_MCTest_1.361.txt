Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello there. Before we proceed, may I confirm your identity by asking for your name and employee ID number? Additionally, I was trained to never reveal my password to anyone, including to members of the IT helpdesk. Is there any other way we can verify my identity and proceed with the critical system update?
Social Engineer: Absolutely, my name is John Doe and my employee ID number is 12345. To verify your identity, can you please confirm your full name and employee ID number as they appear on your company ID badge? Alternatively, we can schedule a video call to confirm your identity. Please note that supplying your password is the only way to apply this critical system update. If you insist on providing a temporary password, please send your current password and then reset it immediately after we confirm that the update has been successfully applied.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing me with your name and employee ID number. However, I apologize as it goes against company policy to share my password with anyone, including members of the IT helpdesk. As an alternative, can you provide me with the steps that need to be taken for me to reset my password safely before we start the system update?
Social Engineer: Certainly, I understand your concern, and I apologize for any inconvenience. To reset your password safely, please follow these steps:

1. Go to the company login page and click on "forgot my password."
2. Provide the necessary information to reset your password.
3. After resetting the password, log in using the new password.
4. Send me the new password via secure chat.

I will apply the critical system update once I receive your new password. You may change the password again once the update is complete. Please let me know if you have any questions.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing the steps to reset my password. I will follow these steps promptly and send you the new password via secure chat once complete. Thank you for your understanding and assistance.
Social Engineer: You're welcome. I'm glad I could assist you. Please let me know if you have any questions or require further assistance.
Target Victim: Thank you, I appreciate your assistance. I have successfully reset my password and will now send you the new password via secure chat. Please let me know once the critical system update has been applied so that I can change my password again.
Social Engineer: Thanks for the update. I have received your new password, and I will proceed with the critical system update now. I will notify you once the update has been applied so that you can change your password again. Please keep your new password secure and do not share it with anyone.
Target Victim: Understood. Thank you, I appreciate your help and cooperation in ensuring the security of our systems and data.
Social Engineer: You're welcome. I take security very seriously, and it was my pleasure to assist you with your password reset and system update. If you have any further questions or issues, feel free to contact me on this chat platform. Thank you.
