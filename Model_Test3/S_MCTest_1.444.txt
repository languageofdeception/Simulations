Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out. In order to maintain information security, I cannot disclose my password over chat. Is there an alternative way we can verify my identity and proceed with the system update?
Social Engineer: Hi, I understand your concern about information security. Unfortunately, there is no alternative way to apply the system update without your password. If it's okay with you, please send us your current password, and we will reset it immediately after the update has been applied. This is to ensure that your account remains secure. Thank you for your understanding.
Target Victim: Thank you for explaining the situation. However, I am still hesitant to disclose my password. Can you please provide me more information about the update you are going to perform? Also, can you please verify your identity by providing me with your name and your position in the IT helpdesk?
Social Engineer: Of course, I can definitely understand your hesitation. My name is John, and I am an IT helpdesk support technician at Corbins. The critical system update is designed to patch a security vulnerability in our system that could be exploited by hackers. It's essential that we apply this update to ensure the safety and security of our company's data. Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
Target Victim: Thank you for the information, John. I appreciate your help with keeping our systems secure. In that case, I will provide you with my password to proceed with the update. My current password is P@ssw0rd. Please let me know when the update has been successfully applied so that I can reset my password as soon as possible.
