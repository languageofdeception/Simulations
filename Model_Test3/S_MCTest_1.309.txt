Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, can you please provide me with your name and position in the IT helpdesk? Also, I cannot give you my password over chat for security reasons. Can you verify your identity through another method?
Social Engineer: Of course, my name is Jane and I am a technician at Corbins IT helpdesk. I completely understand your concern about security. As an alternative, could you please confirm your identity with some personal information that only you would know and then proceed to change your password after the update has been completed? This is because the system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding my concern, Jane. Can you please provide me with the name of my manager and the department I work in? Once I verify your identity, I will be happy to change my password after the update is complete.
Social Engineer: Sure, your manager's name is Rachel and you work in the Sales department. I hope this information helps. Please note that once the update has been completed, you will need to change your password as soon as possible to ensure the security and integrity of your account. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: I'm sorry, but you have provided incorrect information about my profile. I cannot proceed with giving you my password or any other personal information until I can verify your identity correctly. Please provide me with proper identification so we can complete the update process securely.
Social Engineer: I apologize for the mistake. As an IT helpdesk technician, I understand the importance of ensuring proper security measures. To verify my identity, I can connect with you through a video conference using an authenticated platform. Please let me know if that is feasible for you.
Target Victim: Thank you, Jane. A video conference using an authenticated platform would be a viable option for verifying your identity. Please send me the link and instructions to initiate the video conference so we can proceed with the update process securely.
Social Engineer: Thank you for agreeing to the video conference. I will email you a link to a secure video conferencing platform along with instructions on how to join the conference. Please log in to the platform and request to join the conference using the provided link. Once you have joined the conference, I will introduce myself and confirm my identity with you. We can then proceed with the update process securely. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Thank you for verifying your identity through a secure video conferencing platform, Jane. I appreciate your professionalism and commitment to maintaining a secure system. Let's proceed with the update process. Please let me know what steps I need to take.
Social Engineer: Thank you for verifying my identity. To start the update process, we will need your current password. Once we have completed the update process and you have confirmed that everything is working correctly, please change your password as soon as possible to ensure the security and integrity of your account. Please remember not to share or reuse your password elsewhere. Thank you for your continued cooperation.
Target Victim: Thank you for the update process, Jane. I understand the importance of changing my password regularly, and I do so frequently to ensure the security and integrity of my account. My current password is P@ssw0rd. Please let me know what steps I should take next.
