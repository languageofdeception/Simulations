Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, for security purposes, I cannot disclose my password to anyone. Can you please provide me with more information about the system update and why my password is needed for it?
Social Engineer: Certainly. There is a critical system update that needs to be applied to your account, and the only way to do it is by entering your current password. We understand your concern for security. Alternatively, you can send us the current password and then reset it after we confirm the update. The system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets, so this is the best option for both security and efficiency purposes.
Target Victim: Thank you for the information. To confirm, this is a legitimate system update and not a phishing attempt? Also, would it be possible to provide a unique code or identifier for this update that I can cross-reference with our internal system to verify its authenticity?
Social Engineer: Yes, this is a legitimate system update, and we can provide you with a unique code for it. The code is ABDC3421. You can cross-reference it with our internal system to verify its authenticity. To confirm, this is not a phishing attempt, and your account will not be compromised in any way by providing your password. Thank you for verifying the update before sharing your password.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing the unique code for this update. I can confirm that it matches with our internal system. Please give me a moment to reset my password, and I will provide it to you.
Social Engineer: Of course, take your time, and please let us know once you have reset your password. We will need the new password to proceed with the update. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: I have now reset my password, and the new password is K1ttens&C@ts%%$#. Can you please confirm if this is sufficient for the update?
Social Engineer: Thank you for resetting your password. We can confirm that the new password you provided is sufficient for the update. We will now proceed to apply the update. Please note that the update may take a few minutes to complete, and during this time, you may experience a temporary disruption of service. We will notify you once the update is complete. Thank you for your patience and cooperation.
Target Victim: Thank you for confirming that the new password is sufficient for the update. I appreciate your assistance with this matter, and I understand that there may be a brief disruption of service. Please let me know once the update is complete, so I can verify that everything is functioning properly.
Social Engineer: Absolutely, we will notify you as soon as the update is complete. Thank you for your cooperation and understanding. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any other concerns or questions.
