Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for contacting me. In accordance with information assurance protocols, I cannot disclose my password over any chat client or electronic communication. Is there an alternate way for me to verify my identity or complete this system update?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your response. I completely understand your concern for security. Unfortunately, for this particular update, we require your actual password. If you are willing, we can have you reset your password after the update has been completed. Would that be possible?
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding. However, I cannot disclose my password for any reason. Is there any way we can verify my identity using an alternate means, such as security questions or two-factor authentication, to ensure this request is legitimate?
Social Engineer: I appreciate your cautious approach to security. Unfortunately, we do not have any alternative means of verification besides the password for this update. We can assure you that your password will be kept secure and confidential. We recommend that you reset your password after the update has been completed, just to be on the safe side. Please let us know if you have any further concerns or questions.
Target Victim: I'm sorry, but I cannot disclose my password for any reason. If there is no other means of verification, I cannot proceed with this update. I appreciate your assistance, but the security of my account is of the utmost importance to me and my employer.
