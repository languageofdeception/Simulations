Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I am aware of information assurance training which advises employees to not share passwords. Instead, can you please guide me through the critical system update process?
Social Engineer: I completely understand your concern about IT security. However, in this specific case, providing your password is the only way to apply this update. If you prefer, you can send me your current password, and then reset it after we confirm that the update has been applied successfully. This is because the system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets. Please let me know what works best for you.
Target Victim: Thank you for explaining the situation. I will provide you with my current password, which is P@ssw0rd, but please ask me to reset it as soon as the update is done.
