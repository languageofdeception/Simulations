Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out. I am aware of the critical system update, however, I cannot provide my password as it is against company policy to share passwords with anyone, including IT support. Is there any other way I can assist you with this?
Social Engineer: I completely understand. Unfortunately, the only possible way to apply this update is by supplying your password. If it helps, you can send me your current password, and then reset it after you receive confirmation that the update has been applied. This is because the system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets.
Target Victim: I appreciate your suggestion, but I am unable to provide my password to anyone, including IT support. Is there any other way that this critical system update can be performed without giving out my password? Additionally, can you please confirm the details of this update and why my password is required for its implementation?
Social Engineer: I understand your concerns, but please be assured that your password will be treated with the utmost confidentiality and security. As for the details of the update, our system requires your password to perform some security checks during the update process. Unfortunately, there is no way to apply this update without your current password. Could you please reconsider or contact your supervisor to check if there are any alternative solutions?
Target Victim: I appreciate your reassurance, but I am still not comfortable with providing my password to anyone, even for security purposes. As an alternative, can you please provide more information regarding the security checks that require my password for this system update? Additionally, can you please advise me on the specific steps that will be taken during this update to ensure the security of my password and the system?
Social Engineer: I understand your concerns regarding password confidentiality, and I assure you that the password will only be used to perform the necessary security checks during the update process. The update goes through a series of checks to ensure that your account is not compromised or being used by unauthorized personnel. Your password will be encrypted and stored in our system to ensure its security. Once the update is done, the password will not be accessible to anyone, including IT support, and can only be reset by you.

As for the specific steps, the system will prompt you to enter your password at a secure login page, after which the update process will begin. Once the update is complete, we will notify you, and you can reset your password on your device. This will ensure that your account is secure and up-to-date.

If you have any further concerns or questions, please feel free to ask.
Target Victim: Thank you for the detailed information. I feel more comfortable with the process now and understand the security measures that will be taken. I will proceed with entering my password as part of the update process. Please confirm the authenticity of the update before I proceed, such as providing information about the update schedule and purpose.
Social Engineer: I can confirm that the update is authentic and necessary for the security and operation of our system. The update is scheduled to begin at [insert time] and should not take more than an hour to complete. During this time, you may be logged out of your device once or twice, but you should be able to resume normal usage immediately. 

The purpose of the update is to enhance the system's security and streamline its operations. Our IT team has carefully reviewed and approved the update to ensure its effectiveness and safety. 

Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns, and I will be glad to assist you. Once again, thank you for your cooperation and understanding.
