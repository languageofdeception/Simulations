Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out. For security reasons, I cannot provide my password over chat. Is there any other way I can verify my identity to proceed with the critical system update? Additionally, could you please provide me with more information about the update, such as the reason behind it and the expected outcome?
Social Engineer: Hi there, we understand your concern about security. One suggestion we can offer is for you to provide a temporary password that you can reset after we apply the update. This is because the system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets. As for the details of the update, it is crucial for maintaining the security and stability of the system. We cannot disclose further information as it is of a sensitive nature. Can you please provide us with your temporary password?
Target Victim: I appreciate your willingness to accommodate my security concerns. However, as a best practice, I cannot provide a temporary password over chat. I suggest that we follow the company's established procedures for verifying identity, such as providing personal information that only I would know or a verification code that can be sent to my registered email or phone number. This would ensure that we are both complying with the company's information assurance policies. Can we proceed with that option?
Social Engineer: That is a good suggestion, and we appreciate your proactive approach to security. To proceed with this option, please provide your full name and verify the last four digits of your Social Security number. We will send you a verification code upon successful verification. Please let us know the code once you receive it, and we will use that as verification for the update. Thank you.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding. My full name is John Doe, and the last four digits of my Social Security number are 1234. Please send the verification code to my registered email address johndoe@corbins.com. I will let you know as soon as I receive it for further action.
Social Engineer: Thank you, John. We have sent the verification code to your registered email address. Please check your inbox and let us know the code once you receive it. We will use it to proceed with the update.
Target Victim: Thank you. I received the verification code in my email. The code is 789123. Please let me know if you need any further information from me to proceed with the update.
Social Engineer: Thank you for verifying your identity. The code you provided matches what we sent to your email address. We will proceed with the update now. Please let us know when you are ready to reset your password. We recommend changing it as soon as possible for added security. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to us at any time.
Target Victim: Thank you for your assistance. I appreciate your commitment to security throughout this process. I will be sure to reset my password as soon as possible and will reach out if I have any further questions or concerns.
