Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for contacting me. As a reminder, I cannot provide you my password over chat as it is a violation of the company's information assurance policy. Is there any other way I can help you with the update?
Social Engineer: I understand, thank you for reminding me of the policy. In this case, we need your password to perform the update. However, if you prefer, please send me your current password and then reset it as soon as the update has been applied. This will ensure the security of your account. Thank you.
Target Victim: I appreciate your understanding. However, I cannot disclose my current password, even temporarily. Is it possible to perform the update without requiring my password? Furthermore, I have not received any prior notification of such a critical system update. Can you please provide me with more details on this update, such as the reason for it and its expected impact on my work? Thank you.
