Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I am aware that providing passwords over chat clients can be risky and not secure. May I know your name and can you please provide me with more details about the update?
Social Engineer: I completely understand your concern. My name is John. The update is critical for securing our systems against potential security threats. Unfortunately, the only possible way to apply this update is by entering your password. If you prefer a temporary password, you can send me your current password and reset it after the update. Please let me know your thoughts.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding my concern, John. As per our Information Assurance training, we should not share our passwords with anyone, including IT support. However, I understand that the update is critical, so can you please provide me with the steps that I need to follow to apply the update without giving away my password? Can you please provide more details about the update so that I can understand the urgency of it?
Social Engineer: I completely understand, and I appreciate your commitment to security. As for the update, it's regarding a vulnerability that was discovered recently, and it's essential to fix it before any potential security breaches occur. Unfortunately, the system doesn't allow us to apply the update without entering your password. However, if you have any concerns, we can arrange for a remote session where we can perform the update together, and you can watch everything happening on your computer. Would that be okay with you?
Target Victim: Thank you for explaining, John. I appreciate the offer to arrange a remote session, and I think that would be a good way to apply the update without sharing my password. Can you please provide me with the details on how to initiate the remote session? Also, can you please send me an email with the details of the update, including what the vulnerability is and how it could impact our systems? This will help me understand the urgency of the update and its importance.
Social Engineer: Absolutely. We can initiate a remote session by using a secure remote access tool that we use for these types of situations. I'll send you an email with the details on how to initiate the session and the tool we will be using. Additionally, I'll send you an email with more information regarding the update, including the potential impact of the vulnerability and the urgency of applying the update. Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.
Target Victim: Thank you, John, I really appreciate your cooperation and understanding. Please send me the email with the details and instructions, and I will proceed with the remote session on my end.
Social Engineer: You're welcome. I'm sending the email right now, so please check your inbox. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to let me know.
Target Victim: Thank you, John. I have just received the email, and I will follow the instructions to initiate the remote session and proceed with the update. If I have any questions or concerns, I will reach out to you. Thank you for your assistance and your punctuality.
Social Engineer: You're welcome. I'm glad to hear that you received the email, and if you have any questions or concerns, feel free to let me know. I will be happy to assist you. Thank you for your cooperation, and have a great day.
