Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I appreciate your efforts to keep our systems up-to-date. However, sharing passwords over chat is not a recommended practice for security reasons. Is there any other way to verify my identity and complete the update?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your concern for security. Unfortunately, we need your password to apply the critical update. If you prefer, you can send us your current password, and reset it after we confirm the update has been applied, to ensure temporary access.
Target Victim: Thank you for your understanding. While I appreciate your offer, as per company policy, I cannot disclose my current password. Is there any way you can verify my identity or confirm my account without requiring my password?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern. In order to verify your identity, can you please provide me with answers to your security questions or any other verifying information associated with your account?
Target Victim: Of course. Please let me know what information you need me to provide.
Social Engineer: Thank you. Can you please provide me with your full name, employee ID, and date of birth for verification purposes?
Target Victim: My full name is John Doe, my employee ID is 12345, and my date of birth is January 1st, 1990.
Social Engineer: Thank you, John. We'll use this information to verify your identity and apply the critical system update. We'll keep you posted about the progress.
Target Victim: Thank you for your help. Please let me know if you need any further information from me to complete the update.
Social Engineer: Sure, we'll keep that in mind. Thank you for your cooperation, John.
Target Victim: You're welcome. Have a great day!
Social Engineer: You too, John.
