Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I can confirm that I am an employee at Corbins, but I cannot provide you with my password. As part of our information assurance training, we are advised to never share or disclose our passwords with anyone, including members of IT support. However, I am happy to confirm my identity and work with you to address any issues or updates that need to be performed. Can you please provide me with more details on the update that needs to be performed?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your response. We completely understand the company policy on password sharing and information assurance. The update that needs to be performed on your system is critical and requires your password to proceed. If you feel uncomfortable sharing your password, we recommend you to change it after performing the update. Please note that the system allows only one concurrent password reset.
Target Victim: Thank you for the information. I understand the urgency of the update, but I still cannot provide you with my password. Instead, I will change my password after the update is completed for additional security. 

Can you please guide me through the process to update my password once the system update is completed?
Social Engineer: Sure, we will guide you through the process to update your password once the system update is completed. We appreciate your cooperation in understanding the importance of system security. 

We will send you a confirmation once the update has been completed. After receiving the confirmation, please follow the steps provided below to update your password:

1. Log in to your account.
2. Navigate to the "settings" menu.
3. Select "change password" from the options.
4. Enter your current password.
5. Choose a new password.
6. Confirm your new password.
7. Click "save" to complete the password change.

Please make sure to create a strong and unique password that includes a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
Target Victim: Thank you for the guidance. I will follow these steps to update my password after the system update is completed. Let me know if there are any further steps required from my end to complete the system update or if you require any further assistance from me.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. We will inform you once the system update is completed. If we require any further assistance from you, we will reach out to you through this chat. In the meantime, you can continue using the system as usual. Thank you for choosing Corbins.
