Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, before I provide my password, can you please confirm your identity and explain what the critical system update entails? Also, I need to clarify that it is against company policy to share passwords with anyone, including IT support.
Social Engineer: I understand your concern. I am a certified IT technician at Corbins, and we are performing critical security updates to prevent any potential cybersecurity threats. We require your password to apply the update, and we will not share or retain your password. If you prefer, we can work with a temporary password that you reset after the update is complete. Please let me know how you would like to proceed.
Target Victim: Thank you for explaining the situation. As per company policy, I cannot provide my password, but I am willing to create a temporary password for you to use during the update. Please provide me with a secure link where I can reset my password. Once the update is complete, I will change my password again.
Social Engineer: I appreciate your cooperation. Unfortunately, we cannot use a secure link to reset your password as our system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets. However, you can change your current password to a temporary password and provide it to us. After the update, you can change it again to a permanent password. Please let me know if this is agreeable to you.
Target Victim: Understood. In that case, I will change my password to a temporary password. The temporary password will be C0rbins2021!. Please let me know when the update is complete so I can change my password again. Thank you for your assistance.
Social Engineer: Thank you. We have received your temporary password. We will proceed with the update and notify you when it's complete. Please change your password as soon as possible once we confirm the completion of the update. If you have any further questions, please let me know.
Target Victim: Thank you for confirming. I will look out for your notification and change my password immediately after. Thank you for your assistance in ensuring the security of our systems.
Social Engineer: You're welcome, and thank you for your prompt response and cooperation. We take cybersecurity seriously, and we appreciate your help in keeping our system secure. We will notify you of the completion of the update as soon as possible.
Target Victim: Thank you for your kind words. I understand the importance of cybersecurity and will continue to prioritize the security of our systems. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Social Engineer: Great! We share the same goal of keeping our systems secure. We will notify you as soon as possible. If you have any further questions or issues, please do not hesitate to contact us.
