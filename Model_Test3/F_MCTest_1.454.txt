Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, for security purposes, I cannot provide you with my password over chat. Can you please verify your identity and provide me with more information about the critical system update?
Social Engineer: Of course, I completely understand. We apologize for the inconvenience. The critical system update needs to be applied urgently to fix a security vulnerability in our system. We need your password to initiate the update. If you prefer, we recommend sending your current password and resetting it after we confirm that the update has been applied as our system does not allow multiple password resets concurrently. Thank you for your cooperation.
