Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the importance of system updates. However, I must follow proper security protocols to protect our systems and data. May I verify your identity and the reason for needing my password before providing it?
Social Engineer: Absolutely. I am an IT helpdesk support technician at Corbins. We need your password to apply a critical system update that is necessary for maintaining the security and stability of our systems. Please let me know if you need further verification.
Target Victim: Thank you for verifying your identity and purpose. I appreciate you providing that information. As per our company's security policies and best practices, I cannot share my password with anyone, not even IT personnel. Instead, may I suggest that we set up a session where you can remotely access my device and perform the necessary updates? That way, we can ensure the security of our systems and data, while also addressing the required update.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your concern regarding security. Unfortunately, updating your device remotely is not possible in this case. However, if you prefer, you can temporarily provide your password to us so that we can apply the update, and then reset it afterward. We use secure methods to store and protect login credentials. Additionally, we suggest creating a unique and strong password that is different from passwords used for personal accounts.
Target Victim: I understand your suggestion, but I cannot provide my password due to our company's security protocols. Is there an alternative way to verify my identity or perform the updates securely without the need for a password? For example, we can verify each other's identity with our employee IDs, and then I can provide permission for you to access my device and perform the necessary updates, using a privileged account that already has access.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your suggestion. Yes, we can verify each other's identity using our employee IDs, and then you can provide permission for us to access your device and perform the updates using a privileged account. However, please note that in this case, we will require access to your system to perform the update, and we will need your cooperation to complete the process. Is this approach acceptable to you?
Target Victim: Yes, I am comfortable with this approach, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me to ensure the security of our systems. Please let me know the next steps to proceed with the update process, and I will co-operate with you to get it done.
Social Engineer: Great! The next step is to verify each other's identity using our employee IDs. Once we have verified each other, we will use a privileged account to access your device and perform the necessary updates. I will send you a secure link to download the remote access tool that we will use for this process. Let me know when you are ready to proceed, and we will start the verification process.
Target Victim: Thank you for the information. However, I would like to confirm that the remote access tool you are providing is from a verified source, and the link you are sending is legitimate. Could you please provide me with the name of the software so that I can verify its legitimacy?
Social Engineer: Certainly, I understand your concern about the legitimacy of the software. We will only use remote access tools from reliable sources, and the link I will be sending you is legitimate. The name of the software we will be using is TeamViewer. You can verify the legitimacy of the software by visiting their official website at www.teamviewer.com. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing me with the name of the software. I am aware of TeamViewer and its legitimacy. I am ready to proceed with the verification. Please provide me with your employee ID, and I will provide you with mine so we can verify each other's identity.
Social Engineer: Great! My employee ID is IT1005. Please provide me with your employee ID, and I will verify your identity.
