Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I appreciate your assistance with the critical system update. However, I cannot provide you with my password as it is against the company's information assurance policy to share passwords with anyone, including IT support. Is there any other way I can assist with the update process?
Social Engineer: Hello, I understand your concern about sharing your password. However, we need your password for the update to work. If possible, please provide your current password and then reset it after you receive confirmation that the update has been applied. This is because the system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets. Thank you for your understanding.
Target Victim: Thank you for clarifying the need for my password. I apologize for any inconvenience, but I cannot share my current password with anyone, as it is confidential and I must protect it as per company policies. However, I will reset my password after the update has been applied and share the new password with you to ensure the security of our systems. I appreciate your understanding in this matter.
Social Engineer: Thank you for understanding the importance of maintaining the security of our systems. Please reset your password after we have applied the update and share the new password with me. We will let you know once the update has been applied successfully. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Thank you for your cooperation as well. I will reset my password and share the new one with you once I receive confirmation that the update has been applied successfully. Please let me know if you require any other information or assistance from me with the update process.
Social Engineer: Thank you, we appreciate your assistance in this matter. We will let you know once the update has been applied successfully. If we require any other assistance, we will reach out to you. Thank you again for your cooperation.
Target Victim: You're welcome, and thank you for reaching out to me. I'll be waiting to hear back from you about the update. If you need any further assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. Have a great day!
Social Engineer: Thank you, and have a great day too! We will inform you as soon as the update is completed.
Target Victim: Thank you, I look forward to hearing from you soon regarding the update. Have a great day ahead!
Social Engineer: Thank you, you too!
