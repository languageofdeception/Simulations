Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I am happy to assist you with the system update. However, for security reasons, I cannot disclose my password. Can you please provide me with more information about the update and the steps that need to be taken? Moreover, I want to ensure that I am communicating with a legitimate IT support employee. Could you please provide me with your name and employee ID?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your concern about security. Rest assured, I am a verified IT support technician. To proceed with the update, we require your password. Alternately, if you prefer, you can submit a temporary password, perform the update, and immediately change your password. The update is critical and requires immediate attention. Let me know which option you prefer.
Target Victim: Thank you for confirming your identity. I appreciate that this update is critical, but sharing my password is strictly against company policy and violates our information security protocols. As an alternative, I can change my password to a temporary one and share that with you. Once the update is complete, I will immediately change my password back to my original one. Please let me know how to proceed.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your understanding of our security protocols. Please go ahead and change your password to a temporary one and share it with me. We will update the system and send you confirmation once the update is complete so that you can change your password back to your original one. Additionally, please ensure that the temporary password is not the same as your current or previous passwords. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Thank you for your assistance. I have now changed my password to a temporary one - "TempP@ssw0rd". Please let me know once you have completed the update, so I can change my password back to my original one.
