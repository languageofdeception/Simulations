Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the need to update the system, but for security purposes I cannot provide my password to you. Is there any other way we can proceed with the update?
Social Engineer: Hello, I completely understand your concern for security. Unfortunately, the only possible way to apply this update is by entering your password. However, if you insist on providing a temporary password, please send me your current password and then reset it after you receive confirmation that the update has been applied. This is because the system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding my concerns for security. However, for compliance reasons, I cannot provide my current password or create a temporary password for anyone, even IT. Is there any other way the update can be applied without disclosing my password or creating a temporary password?
Social Engineer: I understand your compliance restrictions. Unfortunately, there is no other way to apply this update without entering your password. However, I assure you that your password will be handled with utmost care and confidentiality. We have strict security protocols in place to ensure that your password is only used for the purpose of applying this update, and it will not be shared or stored in any way. Is there anything else that I can assist you with?
Target Victim: I appreciate your reassurance, but I would still feel more comfortable not sharing my password. Can you please provide more details about the update and the reason why my password is needed to perform it?
Social Engineer: Certainly, the update includes important security patches and critical bug fixes for our system. It is essential to apply these updates as soon as possible to prevent any potential vulnerabilities or security breaches. However, due to the sensitive nature of the update, we need to perform it via a specific process that requires your password. Our system is designed to ensure the password is encrypted and stored securely while it is being used to apply the update. Once the update is complete, the password will be discarded from the system.
Target Victim: Thank you for the explanation. I understand the need for the update and the importance of maintaining security. I will proceed with providing my password, but I would appreciate it if you can change it immediately after applying the update. Also, please let me know once the update has been successfully applied.
Social Engineer: I appreciate your cooperation in providing your password. Your password will be handled with the utmost care and confidentiality. Once the update is complete, we will immediately change your password to ensure security. We will let you know once the update is successfully applied, and you can then reset your password as soon as possible. Thank you for your understanding and trust in our team.
Target Victim: Thank you for your understanding and assistance. Please let me know if there is any additional information or action required on my end regarding the update.
Social Engineer: You're welcome! We will take care of everything from our end, and no further actions are required from you. Once the update is complete, you may continue using the system as usual. If you have any issues or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact us. Thank you for your prompt response and cooperation.
