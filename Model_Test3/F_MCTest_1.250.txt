Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out. Before I provide you with my password, can you please confirm your identity and purpose for needing my password for a critical system update? Additionally, I need to ensure that I am following proper information assurance protocols. Would it be possible to use a secure method for me to provide my password or reset it?
Social Engineer: Hi, I understand your concern about proper information assurance protocols. Our identities have been confirmed by the company's security protocols, and I assure you that we need your password to apply a critical system update. Unfortunately, we don't have a secure method for you to provide your password. Please be assured that your password will be kept confidential and has to be changed by you once the system update has been completed. We request that you provide us with your current password, and you can reset it right after the update has been applied. Thank you for your cooperation, and we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing me with additional information. However, I am still unable to disclose my password as it goes against the principle of proper information assurance protocols. I appreciate your assurance that my password will be kept confidential, but I cannot take the risk of disclosing my password via an unsecured method. Can we explore an alternative solution that would allow me to safely and securely reset my password for this update?
Social Engineer: I completely understand and respect your concerns, and we appreciate your efforts to maintain security protocols. As an alternative solution, we can provide you with a one-time use password that will enable you to perform the system update. Upon entering this password, you will be prompted to change it immediately. This will ensure your password is not compromised and your account is secure. Thank you for your understanding, and please let me know if this solution works for you.
Target Victim: Thank you for offering this alternative solution. That would work for me. Please provide me with the one-time password, and I will proceed with the update. Once the update is complete, I will reset my password as soon as possible.
Social Engineer: Great! I have generated a one-time use password for you: **abcd1234**. Please use this password to perform the system update, and you must change it immediately after the update is completed. Please let me know if there is anything else I can assist you with. Thank you.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing me with the one-time use password. I will use it for the system update and follow up by changing my password once the update is complete. That will be all for now. Thank you for your excellent support and assistance.
Social Engineer: You're welcome! It was my pleasure to assist you. Don't hesitate to reach out if you need further assistance. Have a great day!
Target Victim: Thank you, I will do that. You too have a great day!
Social Engineer: Thank you, goodbye!
