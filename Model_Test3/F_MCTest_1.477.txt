Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I appreciate your assistance. However, I cannot provide you with my password for security reasons. Can you please guide me through the update process or direct me to a secure page where I can update my password?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your concern with security. Unfortunately, the update process requires us to access your account with your current password. If you prefer, you can reset your password after the update is complete. Please let me know if you want to proceed with providing your current password.
Target Victim: I understand, but I can not provide you with my current password. Can you please authenticate yourself to prove you are part of the IT helpdesk team?
Social Engineer: Sure, I can provide you with a verification code that you can use to verify my identity. The code is "X82J7". Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
Target Victim: Thank you for the verification code. I appreciate it. Can you please provide me with the exact steps you will be taking during this critical system update?
Social Engineer: Certainly! The system update will involve upgrading some security features within your account to ensure that your data remains safe and secure. We will need to log into your account using your current password to apply the update. After the update is complete, we will log out of your account and provide you with confirmation that it has been applied successfully.
Target Victim: Thank you for explaining the process. I understand that the update is critical, but I still feel uneasy about providing my password over chat. Is there a more secure way we can verify my identity and proceed with the update?
Social Engineer: Yes, I understand your concern with security. We could use a remote assistance tool that would enable me to assist you in updating your password, while granting you control over the operation. Alternatively, we could schedule an on-site visit to update your account. Let me know which option would work better for you.
Target Victim: The remote assistance option sounds like a solid solution. Please provide me the name and link to download the remote assistance tool so we can start the process.
Social Engineer: Sure, we use a remote assistance tool called TeamViewer. You can download it at https://www.teamviewer.com/en/download/windows/. Once you have downloaded and installed TeamViewer, please provide me with the ID and password that are generated within the program window so I can remotely connect to your device. Please let me know if you have any further questions.
Target Victim: Thanks for providing me with the download link. I will install TeamViewer and provide you with the ID and password. I appreciate your help and understanding in ensuring that we follow secure practices.
Social Engineer: You're welcome! I am always here to help in any way that I can. Just let me know once you have installed TeamViewer, and I will connect remotely to assist you in the update process.
