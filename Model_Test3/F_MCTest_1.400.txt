Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hi, I am aware of the importance of information security. Can you please provide me the ticket number or any information that confirms the legitimacy of this request? Also, I cannot disclose my password over chat as it is against Corbins' information security policy.
Social Engineer: Absolutely, I completely understand your concern. The ticket number is [#123456]. It is essential to patch a critical vulnerability that can compromise the security of our systems. Unfortunately, the only possible way to perform the update is by supplying your password. If you insist on a temporary password, we ask that you provide us with your current password and then reset it after the update has been applied. Please let me know if you have any questions.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing the ticket number. I appreciate you explaining the urgency of the situation. However, I cannot disclose my current password over chat, as it is against Corbins' information security policy. I understand that there may be no other way to perform the update, but I would like to suggest an alternative solution. Can we use a temporary one-time password that will expire after the update has been applied? This will allow me to maintain the confidentiality of my current password, while also allowing the update to be performed.
Social Engineer: Thank you for suggesting an alternative solution. We appreciate your efforts to maintain the confidentiality of your password. Unfortunately, our system does not allow for one-time passwords, and we require your actual password to perform the update. However, we can assure you that your password will be kept safe and secure. If you remain hesitant to provide your current password, we can schedule a remote session with one of our IT specialists to perform the update. Please let us know if you would like to proceed with a remote session.
Target Victim: I appreciate that you're taking measures to ensure my password's safety and temptations of human error. In this case, I would like to proceed with the remote session for the critical update. Please let me know what information you require, and what steps I need to take to set up a remote session with an IT specialist.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your cooperation. We will schedule the remote session with one of our IT specialists shortly and will provide you with all the necessary information, including how to download and run the remote access tool. The IT specialist will remotely access your computer and perform the required update. Before the remote session, please make sure that your computer is connected to the internet and that you have a stable internet connection. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to ask, and we will gladly assist you.
Target Victim: Thank you for your prompt response. I will ensure that my computer is connected to the internet and has a stable internet connection. If any further information or action is required on my end, please let me know, and I will ensure that it gets done promptly.
Social Engineer: You're welcome. We will email you the instructions and information regarding the remote session. Please closely follow the instructions provided, and inform us when you have completed the necessary steps. If you face any technical difficulties or have any questions, please let us know, and we will ensure that the remote session proceeds smoothly.
