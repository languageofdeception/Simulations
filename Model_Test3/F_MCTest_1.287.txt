Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I can confirm my identity as an employee at Corbins, but I cannot share my password with you even for a critical system update. Instead, can you guide me through the system update process or provide me with a secure link to reset my password?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your prompt response. Unfortunately, the only possible way to apply this update is by you supplying your password. However, we understand your concern with regards to sharing your password, and we recommend sending us your current password and resetting it once we confirm that the update has been applied. Please let us know if this option works for you.
Target Victim: I appreciate the option, but I cannot share my password over chat. Can we use a more secure method, such as a password reset link sent to my company email address, or can we perform the update together while I am logged in to ensure the security of my password?
Social Engineer: We completely understand your concern regarding password security. As a more secure alternative, we can assist you in resetting your password through our company's password reset process. We will send you a link to your company email address, and from there, you can securely create a new password. Please let us know if this option works for you so we can start the reset process right away.
Target Victim: Thank you for accommodating my request for a more secure process. Yes, that option works for me. Please send the link to my company email address and I will proceed with resetting my password.
Social Engineer: Great, we have just sent you an email with instructions on how to reset your password. Please access your email and follow the steps provided, and let us know if you need any assistance. Once you have reset your password, please send it to us so we can proceed with the critical update. Thank you.
Target Victim: Thank you, I have received the email and will proceed to reset my password. I will also send you the new password as soon as I have created it and logged into the system.
Social Engineer: Great to hear that. Please take your time to reset the password, and once done, kindly send us the new password to proceed with the critical update. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: I have reset my password and created a new one. The new password is "S3cur3P@ssword!". Please confirm when you have received it, and we can proceed with the critical update.
Social Engineer: Thank you for sending the new password. We've received it and will proceed with the critical update now. Once the update is complete, we will inform you so that you can change your password again for security purposes. If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.
Target Victim: Understood. Thank you for your assistance in helping me reset my password and in performing the critical update. Please do inform me when the update is complete so I can change my password again.
