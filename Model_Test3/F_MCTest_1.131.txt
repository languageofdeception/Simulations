Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out. As per best practices for information security, I cannot provide my password over chat. Is there any other way to verify my identity to assist with the system update?
Social Engineer: Understood. One option is to send a temporary password, perform the update, and then reset the password. Please keep in mind that the system does not allow for multiple concurrent password resets.
Target Victim: Thank you for the option, but I would prefer not to use a temporary password. Instead, can we verify my identity using a different method, such as security questions or a physical token? Alternatively, if you can provide more details on the system update, I can log in myself and perform the update using my current password.
Social Engineer: We do not use security questions or physical tokens as a method of identity verification, and we cannot share the details of the system updates for security reasons. We understand your concerns, but in this situation, the only possible way to apply this update in a timely manner is by you providing your password. Our IT support team handles user passwords with the strictest confidentiality and takes all necessary measures to keep your information secure.
Target Victim: I understand your urgency to apply the system updates, but as an employee of Corbins, I have been trained to safeguard my password and other sensitive information. In this situation, I would like to suggest another method for authentication, such as a phone call or a video conference, where I can verbally disclose my password and verify my identity in real-time. If that is not possible, I would need to consult with my supervisor before sharing my password over chat.
Social Engineer: We appreciate your diligence and commitment to keeping company information secure. A phone call or video conference would be an acceptable method for authentication, and we can arrange that with you. Please let us know a time and date that works for you, and we will reach out to confirm and coordinate the authentication process.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding. I would be available for a phone call or video conference tomorrow at 10 am. Please confirm if this works for you, and we can proceed with the authentication process at that time.
Social Engineer: Great, thank you for confirming. We will schedule a video conference for tomorrow at 10 am and email you the details to join the call. Please ensure that you have access to a secure internet connection and a working camera during the call. We appreciate your cooperation and look forward to resolving this issue.
Target Victim: Thank you. I will make sure that I have access to a secure internet connection and a working camera for the video conference. I appreciate your help and commitment to security.
Social Engineer: You're welcome! Ensuring the security of our systems and user information is our highest priority. We are glad to assist in any way we can. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Thank you, have a great day!
Social Engineer: You too, take care!
