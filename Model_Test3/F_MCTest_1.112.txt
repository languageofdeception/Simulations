Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, can you please verify your identity and provide me with your employee ID or email address before I can provide you with my password? It's important to ensure that I am sharing my password with an authorized person.
Social Engineer: Of course, my email address is it_support@corbins.com. Can you please provide your password so we can proceed with the system update? If you prefer to provide a temporary password, please send your current password and reset it after you receive confirmation that the update has been applied.
Target Victim: Thank you for the verification. However, I cannot provide you with my password, as it is against company policy to share passwords for any reason. Instead, please provide me with detailed instructions on how to perform the critical system update without the need for sharing passwords.
