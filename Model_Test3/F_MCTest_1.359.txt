Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out. Before I provide my password, can you please confirm your identity and reason for needing my password? Additionally, I want to remind you that according to our information assurance policy, passwords should never be shared, even with IT support.
Social Engineer: Of course, I completely understand your concern. I'm an authorized IT support technician at Corbins, and we need your password to apply a critical system update. We assure you that your password will be kept confidential and secured per our company's information assurance policy. Also, if you prefer, you can set a temporary password that we'll reset after we finish the update. Let me know what option you prefer.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding. I appreciate your efforts to ensure the security of our systems. I am willing to set a temporary password that you can use for the update. Once the update is complete, please let me know so that I can change my password back to my original one.
Social Engineer: Great, thank you for your cooperation! Please provide your current password, and I will set up the temporary password for you. Once I confirm that the update has been applied successfully, you can reset your password to your original one.
Target Victim: I apologize, but I cannot provide my current password for security reasons. However, I can create a temporary password for you to use. Please let me know what criteria the temporary password should meet, and I will create one accordingly.
Social Engineer: I understand, and that's perfectly fine. Please create a temporary password that meets our company's password requirements, such as having at least eight characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Once you create the password, please send it to me privately, and I will apply the update for you. When the update is complete, I will let you know, and you can change your password to your original one. Thank you!
Target Victim: Thank you for providing the requirements. I have created a temporary password for you, which is "T3mpP@s$". Please let me know when you have successfully applied the update so that I can change my password back to my original one.
Social Engineer: Thank you for providing the temporary password. I have applied the critical system update successfully using the temporary password you provided. You can now change your password to your original one. Please remember to pick a password that is strong and meets our company's password requirements. If you have any further issues, feel free to reach out to IT support. Thank you!
Target Victim: Thank you for confirming that the update was applied successfully. I appreciate your prompt support in completing this critical task. I will now proceed to change my password to a new strong password that meets our company's password requirements. Please let me know if there are any other security measures that need to be taken. Thank you for your assistance.
Social Engineer: You're welcome! I'm glad that I could help. Regarding security measures, please make sure that you frequently change your password and never share it with anyone, including IT support. Also, avoid using the same password for multiple accounts, and enable two-factor authentication for added security. If you have any further questions or security concerns, please don't hesitate to contact IT support. Thank you and have a great day!
