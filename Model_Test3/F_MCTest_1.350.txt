Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the importance of system updates, but for security purposes, I cannot provide my password for any reason. Is there any other way I can assist you with the update process?
Social Engineer: I appreciate your concern for security. Unfortunately, we need your password to apply the update. However, you can provide a temporary password, and once we confirm that the update has been applied successfully, you can reset your password. Does that work for you?
Target Victim: I appreciate the suggestion, but I cannot provide any password at this time. Instead, can you please provide me with the name and details of the update, and I will check with my supervisor to verify if this update is required for our systems?
Social Engineer: The update we are applying is a critical security patch for our systems, which is essential to keep our data secure from potential threats. We recommend for all users to update their systems as soon as possible. If you need more information about the patch or anything related to the update, please let me know and I will provide you with the details.
Target Victim: I appreciate the information. In that case, can you please provide me with clear details regarding the action required from me? Do I need to initiate any action on my end, or will the update and installation be executed from your end?
Social Engineer: Thank you for asking. We will need your login credentials to apply the update. Once I receive your credentials, our team will begin the update process from our end. When the update is complete, we will let you know, and you should be able to log in with your usual password.
Target Victim: Again, I cannot provide my login credentials, for security reasons. Could you please confirm if there are alternative options for applying the security patch, such as a remote installation procedure without the need for credentials?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your concern for security. Unfortunately, to update the system, we require valid login credentials. We understand your hesitation to share your password, but we assure you that the update will only be applied to maintain the security of your data and our systems. We follow strict security guidelines in all our processes, and the details will be kept confidential and secure at all times. Is there anything else I can assist you with?
Target Victim: Thank you for the explanation. I appreciate the importance of keeping the systems up to date, but as per our company policy, we cannot allow sharing of credentials for any reason. Instead, I will contact our IT department directly and request information on how to updated my system in a secure and controlled way. Thank you for your help.
Social Engineer: Understood. We respect your company's policy and appreciate your cooperation in this matter. Please feel free to reach out to your IT department for any information related to the update process. If you have any other queries or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact us. Thank you for your time.
Target Victim: Thank you for your assistance and understanding. Have a great day!
Social Engineer: You're welcome! Have a great day too!
