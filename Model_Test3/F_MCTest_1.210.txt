Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, for security reasons, I cannot provide my password over this chat client. Can you please provide more information about the critical system update and how it will affect my account? If necessary, we can schedule a time for me to physically come to the IT department to perform any necessary updates.
Social Engineer: I understand your concern for security. We need to perform this update urgently to fix a potential security vulnerability in your account. Unfortunately, we cannot schedule a time for you to come to the IT department as this issue needs to be resolved immediately. If possible, could you please provide us with your current password so we can apply the update? Alternatively, you can provide us with a temporary password and reset it immediately after we confirm that the update has been applied.
Target Victim: I appreciate the urgency to resolve the vulnerability, but I cannot provide my current password. However, I can provide you with a temporary password that you can use to apply the update. Please let me know how you would like me to communicate the temporary password to you securely.
Social Engineer: Thank you for cooperating with our request. To send your temporary password securely, you can use our company's secure message system. Once you have sent the message, please let us know here in the chat client that the message is ready for us to retrieve. We will then use the temporary password to apply the update. Once we have completed the update, we will inform you, and you can reset your password. Thank you for your help in keeping our systems secure.
Target Victim: Thank you for the information. I will send the message containing the temporary password via your company's secure message system and will notify you here in the chat client when it is ready. Thank you for your help in resolving this issue.
Social Engineer: You're welcome. We will be on standby to receive the message and apply the update once we receive the temporary password. Please notify us as soon as the message is sent so we can take prompt action. Thank you for understanding and your cooperation.
