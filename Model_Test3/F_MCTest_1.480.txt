Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for contacting me. For security reasons, I am unable to disclose my password over chat. Could you please provide me with more information about the update? Also, is there any other way to authenticate my identity?
Social Engineer: The update is a critical security patch that needs to be applied to your user account immediately. Unfortunately, we cannot authenticate your identity through chat, but we can verify your identity over the phone. Please be assured that all personal and confidential information will remain strictly confidential. Is it possible for you to share your current password over the phone with me? We understand and respect your concerns regarding security, and in case you prefer to reset your password after providing the current one, we encourage you to do so.
Target Victim: Thank you for your explanation. I understand the criticality of security patches, but I still cannot share my password over any medium. I am more than happy to verify my identity over the phone with you if that helps. Please let me know what information you require, and I will be happy to provide it.
Social Engineer: Thank you for understanding. To verify your identity, please share the following information over the phone:

- Your full name as it appears on your company ID or any other official document.
- Your employee ID number.
- Your department name and manager's name.
- Your work email ID.
- Any other information that you think is relevant and can help us verify your identity.

Once we have verified your identity, we will gladly assist you with the critical security patch. Thank you for your cooperation.
