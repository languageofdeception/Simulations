Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I am happy to help with the update. However, I cannot provide my password as it is against company policy to share passwords. Can you please guide me on the steps I need to take to complete the update process?
Social Engineer: Thank you for letting me know. Unfortunately, the only possible way to apply this update is by providing your password. However, if it helps, once you provide your current password, you can reset it after we confirm that the update has been applied. The system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets, so this will avoid any potential conflicts.
Target Victim: Thank you for the information. However, I am still not comfortable sharing my password. Can you please verify your identity? Maybe you can provide me with some information that only IT support would know, or you could contact me through my company email. This would give me the assurance that you are indeed the person who you claim to be.
Social Engineer: I completely understand your concern regarding sharing your password. For verification purposes, can you please confirm your username? I can then provide you with some information about your recent IT requests.
Target Victim: My username is JohnDoe. Can you please provide me with the information you have?
Social Engineer: Of course, JohnDoe. I see that you submitted a ticket last month regarding a software issue on your computer, which we resolved through remote access. Additionally, a few weeks ago, we assisted you with setting up your new printer. Would that be enough to confirm my identity?
Target Victim: Yes, that information confirms that you are from the IT support team. I appreciate your help with my previous IT requests. However, since sharing passwords is against the company policy and may create a security risk, I am reluctant to share my password. Please let me know if there are any other ways to apply the update without sharing my password.
Social Engineer: I completely understand your concerns. Unfortunately, sharing your password is the only way we can apply this particular update. May I suggest that you temporarily change your password and share the temporary password with me for the update process? This way, you can maintain the security of your account by resetting your password after the update has been applied.
Target Victim: Thank you for the suggestion. I will update my password and share the temporary password with you. Once the update is complete, I will reset my password as soon as possible. Please let me know the next steps.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your cooperation. Please provide me with your temporary password, and I will start the update. After the update is complete, I will notify you. Once you receive the confirmation, please reset your password as soon as possible.
Target Victim: My temporary password is TempP@ssw0rd. Please confirm that you have received it before proceeding.
