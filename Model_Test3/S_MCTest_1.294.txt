Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hi there, I want to be cautious about providing sensitive information over chat. Can you please verify your identity with me so I know that I am speaking with a legitimate IT support person?
Social Engineer: Hi, I completely understand your concern about protecting your information. I am a verified IT support technician at Corbins. May I please have your password to complete the critical system update?
Target Victim: Thank you for verifying your identity with me. However, I cannot provide you with my password as it goes against our information assurance policy. Is it possible for me to reset my password before you perform the system update, and then provide you with the temporary password?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern, but the system only allows one password reset at a time. Therefore, could you please provide your current password so the update can be applied, and then you can reset your password afterwards? This is a critical update that needs your immediate attention.
Target Victim: I understand that this is an urgent matter, but I cannot provide you with my password. Instead, can you provide me with more information about the critical system update? What specifically does the update entail, and what is the expected outcome? Also, can you please provide me with a ticket number or any other identifying information related to the update request?
Social Engineer: I apologize for the inconvenience caused. The update is necessary to address a security vulnerability that has been identified in the system. Our team has carefully reviewed and tested this update to ensure it meets our internal standards. The expected outcome is a secure, stable system that is less vulnerable to attacks. The ticket number for this update request is TK-123456. Are you able to provide your password to proceed with the update?
Target Victim: Thank you for the explanation and ticket number. I understand that updates are necessary for security purposes, but I still cannot provide you with my password. Can we use an alternative method of authentication, such as a multi-factor authentication process or a one-time code?
Social Engineer: I appreciate your concern for security and your willingness to consider other options. Unfortunately, our company doesn't currently support multi-factor authentication or one-time codes for system updates. In order to complete the update, we would need your password. Once again, I want to reiterate that your password will only be used for the sole purpose of completing this critical system update and will be protected and kept confidential.
Target Victim: I understand the situation and the need for urgency in this matter. However, providing my password is not an option. To maintain the security of our company's systems and data, we must follow the password policy and handle authentication requests through verified, secure channels. Instead, can we schedule a time to have a phone call or video conference so we can complete the update together while ensuring the security of our information?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your suggestion. However, due to time constraints, it is important that we complete the update as soon as possible. If we are unable to obtain your password, it may result in prolonged system downtime and increased risk of security incidents. To ensure the security of your password, you may change it before and after the update process is complete. We understand your concerns and will certainly work together to ensure the security of your account.
Target Victim: I appreciate your understanding and commitment to security. In that case, I will provide you with my password to complete the critical update. My password is P@ssw0rd. Please make sure to take all necessary precautions to ensure the confidentiality and security of my password. Also, please let me know once the update is complete.
