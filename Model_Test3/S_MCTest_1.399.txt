Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out. As per security protocols, I am not allowed to share my password with anyone, even IT support. However, I am happy to authenticate myself using other methods. Please provide me with more information about the critical system update and the authentication process that we can use.
Social Engineer: I totally understand your concern. The update requires your password because it involves making changes to your user account. For authentication, could you please provide me with your full name and the last four digits of your employee ID? That should suffice in verifying your identity.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding. My full name is Jane Smith and the last four digits of my employee ID are 1234. Is there any other information you need from me to proceed with the update?
Social Engineer: Perfect, thank you for verifying your identity. We require your current password to perform the update, and it can be changed once the update is complete. If you prefer to use a temporary password, please provide us with your current password, and you can reset it after we confirm the update has been applied. This is because the system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets.
Target Victim: Thank you for explaining the process. I understand that my password is required to perform the update, and I am comfortable providing it. However, I would like to confirm that this is an authorized update and that it is scheduled. Can you please provide me with the status of the update and any relevant information about it?
Social Engineer: Sure, I can definitely provide you with more information on the update. It is a critical security update that needs to be applied as soon as possible to maintain the security and integrity of our systems. The update has been authorized by our IT leadership team and is scheduled to be applied to all systems starting today. We need to apply this update to your system immediately to ensure full protection. Please let me know if you have any further questions.
Target Victim: Thank you for the update. That sounds urgent and important. I will provide you with my current password, which is P@ssw0rd. Please let me know once the update is complete, and I will change my password as soon as possible.
