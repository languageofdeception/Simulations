Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out. As per my information assurance training, I am not permitted to share my password with anyone, including IT support. Is there an alternative way we can perform the critical system update?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern about sharing your password. Unfortunately, there is no alternative way to apply this update other than by supplying your password. In this case, we highly recommend you provide your current password and reset it after we confirm that the update has been applied. This is because our system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets, and we need to apply the update as soon as possible.
Target Victim: I appreciate your explanation, but it is against our company policy to share passwords with anyone, including IT support. Can you please provide me more details about the update and why it requires my password?
Social Engineer: I apologize for the inconvenience. We completely understand your concern about sharing passwords. The critical update we need to perform is related to security patches and vulnerability fixes. Your password is needed to authenticate the update process and ensure that it is performed by a valid user with authorized access rights. Nevertheless, we respect your company's policy, and we can only proceed with a temporary password provided by you. If that is not possible, then we cannot apply the update and will have to wait until you're available to perform it yourself.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing more details about the update and the need for authentication. I appreciate your understanding of our company's policy. As much as I would like to assist you, it is still not acceptable for me to provide my current password. However, I can change my password to a temporary one and provide it to you, so that you can perform the update. After the update is complete, I will change my password again to a new one that only I will know. Would that be possible?
Social Engineer: Thank you for understanding the need for authentication and providing a temporary password. Yes, that sounds feasible. Please generate a temporary password and provide it to me securely through this chat client. I will confirm once the update is complete, and you can change your password immediately after that. Please ensure that your new password meets the company's password policy requirements for a strong and secure password.
Target Victim: Thank you for acknowledging my suggestion. I am happy to generate a temporary password. The temporary password is "Temp@P@ssw0rd". Please confirm that you have received it, and let me know when you have completed the update. After that, I will change my password to a new one that meets our company's password policy requirements.
