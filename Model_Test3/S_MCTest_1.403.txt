Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the importance of system updates, but as per our organization's information assurance policies, I cannot disclose my password over a chat client. Is there any other way by which we can complete the update while maintaining the security of my login credentials?
Social Engineer: I completely understand your concern about data security. However, in this case, the only possible way to complete the update requires your password. If you are open to providing a temporary password, you can reset it afterward once the update is complete. Please let me know if this is possible.
Target Victim: I appreciate your understanding, but as per our information assurance policies, I am not allowed to share or create temporary passwords. Can you please confirm your identity and provide me with some additional verification so that I can be sure that you are an authorized IT helpdesk representative?
Social Engineer: Sure, I can confirm my identity. My name is [insert name], and I am an IT helpdesk support technician at Corbins. To verify my identity, I can provide you with my employee ID number and answer any security questions that you may have to ensure that the request is legitimate. Is there anything else I can provide to help you feel more secure about sharing your password?
Target Victim: Thank you for providing your name. To ensure the legitimacy of the request, please provide me with your employee ID number and email address. Additionally, can you please confirm the specific system update that needs to be performed and its urgency? Once I have verified your identity and the nature of the update, I can proceed with sharing my password.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your vigilance. My employee ID number is [insert ID number], and my email address is [insert email address]. We need your password to perform a critical security update that needs to be completed as soon as possible to protect the company's systems from potential threats. The update is required to patch a security vulnerability that was recently identified in our systems. Can you please share your password with me, and you can reset it after the update is completed?
Target Victim: Thank you for providing me with your employee ID number and email address. I appreciate your explanation about the critical security update. As per your request, I am sharing my password, which is P@ssw0rd. I understand that I must reset it immediately after the system update is completed. Please let me know once the update is done so I can change my password.
