Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the need for security. However, I cannot provide my password over an unsecured chat channel. Is there any other way we can verify my identity?
Social Engineer: I completely understand your concerns. To make sure your password remains secure, you may try to change it temporarily and provide the new password. Once the update is complete, you can change the password again. Let me know if that works for you.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding. I appreciate you offering an alternative solution. However, I would like to verify if this request is legitimate. Can you please provide me with more information about the critical system update and why my password is needed?
Social Engineer: Sure, I understand the need for verification. We are performing a security enhancement to the system, which requires all users to update their passwords to meet new requirements. We will need your current password to apply the update as the system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets. Once the update is complete, you will be required to reset your password again and follow the latest password policy.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing me with more details about the update. I appreciate your concern for security and the explanation helps. However, I would still feel more comfortable changing my password directly through the system. Can you please guide me on how to initiate a password change myself so I can be sure my information is secure?
Social Engineer: Absolutely, I understand your hesitation and will guide you through the password change process. Please follow the steps below:

1. Log in to your Corbins account.
2. Click on your name or profile picture in the top right corner of the screen.
3. Select "Change Password" from the dropdown menu.
4. Follow the prompts to change your password.

Once you have changed your password, we can proceed with the update. Let me know if you need any assistance with the password change process.
Target Victim: Thank you for the detailed instructions. I will follow the steps you provided to change my password. Once the password has been changed, I will provide the new password for the update. Thank you for ensuring the security of my information.
Social Engineer: You're welcome. Take your time with the process and let me know when you're ready to provide the temporary password. We're always here to help if you run into any issues.
Target Victim: Thank you for your assistance. I have successfully changed my password to a temporary one. The new password is "TempPassword123#". Please let me know once the update is complete so I can change my password again following the latest policy.
Social Engineer: Thank you for providing the temporary password. I will use this to perform the update and let you know once it's complete. Please note that your temporary password is valid until we have completed the update, so it's essential that you change it as soon as you receive confirmation from us.
Target Victim: Understood. Thank you for letting me know. I'll ensure to change the password as soon as possible. Please, keep me posted on the update process.
Social Engineer: Absolutely, I will keep you posted on the progress of the update. It may take some time to complete, but I'll let you know as soon as it's done. Thank you for your cooperation and understanding.
