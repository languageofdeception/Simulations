Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, for security reasons, I am not able to provide you my password. May I know what the critical system update is about?
Social Engineer: Sure, the update is needed to resolve a security vulnerability that could potentially harm the system. We strongly encourage you to provide your password for the update. As soon as the update is applied, I can assure you that we will ask you to reset your password for security reasons.
Target Victim: Thank you for the clarification. For security reasons, I am not allowed to give you my password, even for critical updates. However, I am willing to perform the update myself if you could provide me with the necessary instructions.
Social Engineer: I appreciate your concern for security, and I understand why you may not be comfortable sharing your password. Unfortunately, the system requires your password to apply the update. If you're willing to share your password on a temporary basis, we'll take all necessary precautions to protect your information. But if that’s not feasible, I could walk you through the necessary steps to perform the update once you’re ready.
Target Victim: I appreciate your understanding. However, as an employee, I have been instructed not to share my password, even on a temporary basis. Nevertheless, please provide me with the detailed instructions to perform the update, and I will follow them accordingly. Thank you.
Social Engineer: I completely understand and appreciate your commitment to security. Here are the steps to perform the update:

1. Log in to your account.
2. Go to the system update page.
3. Click on the "Update now" button.
4. Follow the prompts to complete the update process.

If you encounter any issues during the update, please don't hesitate to contact us for further assistance. Once again, thank you for your commitment to security.
Target Victim: Thank you for the instructions. I will follow them accordingly. If I encounter any issues, I will definitely reach out to the IT support team for further assistance.
