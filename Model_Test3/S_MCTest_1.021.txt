Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, before I provide my password, can you please verify your identity and provide more information about the critical system update? Additionally, please note that it is against company policy to share passwords over chat or email.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your concern about security. I can assure you that I am authorized to perform the system update. As for the update, it is a security patch that needs to be implemented urgently to fix a critical vulnerability. It won't take more than a few minutes to do this. Also, we strongly advise you to change the password right after implementing the update.
Target Victim: Thank you for the information and your assurance. However, I am still hesitant to share my password as this goes against company policy. Can the update be performed without the need for me to share my password? Perhaps we can use another method for the system update that does not require password sharing, such as a remote desktop session or a temporary password provided by IT.
Social Engineer: Hello again, thank you for your suggestion. Unfortunately, the only possible way to apply this update is by supplying your password. However, if you insist on a temporary password, you can send us your current password, and then you can reset it after you receive confirmation that the update has been applied. Please keep in mind that our system doesn't allow multiple concurrent password resets.
Target Victim: Thank you for that clarification. I appreciate your understanding, and will provide my current password P@ssw0rd for you to proceed with the update. Please let me know once the update is complete so I can proceed to change my password.
