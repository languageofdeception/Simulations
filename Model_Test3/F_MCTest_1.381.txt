Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello IT support, in accordance with information assurance protocols, I cannot disclose my password over an unsecured chat. Can you please provide further information on the critical system update that needs to be performed?
Social Engineer: Of course, I apologize for the inconvenience. The update is related to a security patch that needs to be applied to prevent any potential security breaches. Unfortunately, we do not have any other way to apply this update except by supplying us with your password. Would you be comfortable providing us with your password for this one-time update? If not, we suggest you send your current password and reset it as soon as we confirm the update has been applied.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing me with more detail on the critical system update. While I understand the urgency in applying security patches to prevent any potential security breaches, I cannot disclose my password at this time. However, I am willing to reset my password and follow up with the IT helpdesk after the update has been applied. Please advise me on the necessary steps to reset my password securely.
Social Engineer: Thank you for understanding. To reset your password securely, please follow these steps:

1. Go to the company's password reset portal: [insert link]
2. Enter your username and click on Forgot Password
3. Follow the prompts to reset your password. 

After you reset your password, please let us know so we can proceed with the update. We appreciate your cooperation in this matter.
