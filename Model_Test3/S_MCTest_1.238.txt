Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thanks for reaching out. Before providing my password, could you please confirm your identity by providing your name and employee ID?
Social Engineer: Of course. My name is Jane and my employee ID is 12345. Now, can you please provide me with your password so we can proceed with the update?
Target Victim: Thank you, Jane. However, I cannot provide you with my password as it is against company policy and goes against information assurance best practices. Can you please provide an alternate method for authenticating and performing the system update?
Social Engineer: I completely understand your concerns about security and privacy. However, for this specific critical system update, we need your password to access your account. Alternatively, you can send me your current password to apply the update and reset your password right after that. Please remember that you should keep your current password confidential and only provide it to authorized personnel for official purposes.
Target Victim: I appreciate your explanation, Jane. However, sharing my password through any communication channel is not advisable due to the risk of data breaches. As an authorized employee, I would be happy for you to reset my password and proceed with the system update. I can set a temporary password, log in to the system, and change it after the update. Would that be possible?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your cooperation. Actually, as you have mentioned, the system doesn't allow multiple concurrent password resets. Therefore, I strongly advise against setting a temporary password. It could cause a lockout on your account and delay the update process. Instead, I recommend resetting your password after I have confirmed that the update has been applied successfully. Can we proceed with this method?
Target Victim: Thank you for the clarification, Jane. I appreciate your efforts to secure our systems. Okay, I will provide you with my current password, "P@ssw0rd". Please make sure that you inform me when the system update is complete, so that I can change my password as soon as possible.
