Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I am aware that providing passwords over chat is not a secure practice. Can you please provide further details on the critical system update that needs to be performed? Also, I would like to verify your identity before sharing any sensitive information. Can you please provide me with your name and employee ID?
Social Engineer: Of course, I understand your concerns about security. Unfortunately, in this case, we do need your password to apply the update. I can assure you that I am a verified member of the IT helpdesk team. My name is John and my employee ID is 1234. We need your password to perform security updates on our servers. Alternatively, you could provide us with a temporary password, but please remember to reset it afterward. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Thank you for your response, John. While I appreciate your assurance that you are a verified member of the IT helpdesk team, providing my password over chat still poses a security risk. Is there any way for us to perform this update without revealing my password? Perhaps we could use a temporary token or have the update performed remotely without requiring a password? I want to ensure that we follow the best security practices to protect our company's sensitive information.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your concern about security. Unfortunately, there is no other way to perform the update without your password. However, we can make sure that the chat communication is secure by using an encrypted platform. If you are still uncomfortable with providing your password, you can create a temporary password, which you should reset immediately after the update is complete. Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding my concerns, John. I appreciate the offer to use an encrypted platform for our chat communication. However, due to the sensitive nature of my password, I think it would be best if I create a temporary password that I can reset immediately after the update is complete. 

I will create a temporary password and share it with you in a separate chat window to ensure that we maintain the highest level of security while performing this update. Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your cooperation and being proactive about security. Please let me know when you have created a temporary password, and I will guide you through the next steps of the update process.
Target Victim: Thank you, John. I have created a temporary password. Please let me know what the next steps are.
Social Engineer: Thank you, we can now proceed with the update process. Please provide me with the temporary password you have created so I can apply the update to your account. Once the update is complete, I will verify that it has been successfully applied, and then I recommend that you immediately reset your password.
Target Victim: Thank you, John. Here is the temporary password: TempP@ssw0rd. Please let me know what the next steps are.
