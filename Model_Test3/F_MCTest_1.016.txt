Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello IT support, thank you for reaching out. As much as I'd like to help you with the update, for security purposes, I cannot share my password with anyone over chat. Is there another way I could assist you?
Social Engineer: Hello, we understand your concern about security. However, the update requires your password to be entered. As a workaround, you can send us your current password, and then reset it once we confirm that the update has been applied. Please let us know if this is possible.
Target Victim: Thank you for the clarification. I appreciate your efforts to ensure the security of the system. However, it is not best practice to send passwords over chat or email, even temporarily. Is there a way we can arrange for the update to be performed through a secure channel or have a trusted third-party verify the process?
Social Engineer: Thank you for raising your concerns. We understand your reservations regarding password sharing over chat. Unfortunately, there is no other way to apply the update unless we receive your password. We guarantee that the information will remain strictly confidential and that we will reset your password immediately after completing the update. If you are not comfortable with providing your password, we can schedule a video conference, and you can enter your password on your device while we monitor the session.
Target Victim: Thank you for considering alternate solutions to address my concern. I appreciate the suggestion of a video conference. Please arrange a secure video conference for me to share my password. While sharing my password, I will need to ensure that the session is not being recorded or screen-captured. Please let me know the preferred conferencing tool and schedule, so I can coordinate my availability with you.
Social Engineer: Great! We will arrange a secure video conference that meets your requirements. We will use our company's secure conferencing tool that supports end-to-end encryption. We will send you an invitation with the details, including the date and time. The session will not be recorded or screen-captured, as the conferencing tool does not allow for this. Thank you for your cooperation in ensuring the security of our system.
Target Victim: Thank you for the confirmation. I look forward to the scheduled video conference to complete the update. I appreciate your efforts to ensure that the process is secure and confidential.
Social Engineer: You're welcome! We're happy to accommodate your preferences to make sure everything is secure. Weâ€™ll send you a confirmation of the video conference details soon. If you have any questions in the meantime, please don't hesitate to reach out.
Target Victim: Thank you for the prompt reply and your assistance. I appreciate your help and willingness to answer my questions. Have a great day.
Social Engineer: It was my pleasure assisting you. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. Have a great day!
Target Victim: Thank you!
Social Engineer: You're welcome, have a good one!
