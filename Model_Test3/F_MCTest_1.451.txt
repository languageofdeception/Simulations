Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out. As an employee of Corbins, I am aware of the importance of cybersecurity and maintaining the confidentiality of my password. For security purposes, I cannot disclose my password over a chat client. Is there an alternative method for us to perform the critical system update?
Social Engineer: Hi, I completely understand your concern regarding cybersecurity. However, for this particular update, we require your valid password to go ahead. In case you're uncomfortable sharing your current password, you can reset your password temporarily and share the new one with us. Once the update is completed, you can reset your password again. Please let me know what you prefer.

I will reset my password and share the new one with you. After the update is completed, I will reset my password again for added security. Thank you for your help.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your understanding. Please reset your password and provide me with your new password so we can proceed with the update. I'll wait for your update confirmation before going ahead with the update. If you need any assistance with resetting your password, please let me know.
