Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hi, thank you for reaching out. I understand the importance of system updates, but for security reasons, I cannot provide my password over chat. Can you please guide me through the steps of the update process so that I can perform it myself?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern about security. Unfortunately, this particular system update requires your password to be applied. However, if it makes you more comfortable, you can provide a temporary password that you can reset after we confirm that the update is complete. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding my concerns. I appreciate the offer to provide a temporary password, but I would prefer to reset my password after the update is complete. Can we perform the update at a time when I am available to enter my password myself?
Social Engineer: I completely understand. Unfortunately, this update is time-sensitive and must be applied immediately. As an alternative, we can temporarily reset your password and then reset to a new password of your choice once the update is complete. Would you like to proceed with this option?
Target Victim: I appreciate your willingness to work with me. If resetting my password is the only option, then I agree to proceed with it. Please provide me with the temporary password, and I will ensure to reset it once the update is complete.
Social Engineer: Thank you, I appreciate your cooperation. Your temporary password is "Corbins123". Once the update is complete, you can log in with this password and then reset it to a new password of your choice. Please let me know once you have logged in with the temporary password, and I will initiate the update process.
Target Victim: Thank you for the temporary password, however, as part of our organization's information assurance policy, I cannot confirm the password you provided. Can you please guide me through any necessary steps to ensure the authenticity of this request and confirm that this conversation is taking place on a secure and trusted platform?
Social Engineer: Of course, I completely understand. Our chat client is secured and encrypted end-to-end to ensure the confidentiality of our conversations. As for the verification process, I will provide you with a verification code that you can use to verify this request. Please confirm if you are ready to receive the code, and I will provide it to you.
Target Victim: Thank you for the clarification. Yes, I am ready to receive the verification code and proceed with the update. Please provide the code.
Social Engineer: Great. The verification code is "A3B7D9". Please enter this code in the chat to confirm that you have received it and that we can proceed with resetting your password for the update.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing the verification code. I have received the code, and I confirm that we can proceed with the password reset for the update. Please reset my password to "CorbinsTemp123" and I will log in, complete the update, and reset to a new password afterwards.
Social Engineer: Thank you for confirming the verification code, and I have successfully reset your password to "CorbinsTemp123". Please log in with this password and complete the system update. Once the update is complete, please remember to reset your password to a new, strong password of your choice. If you have any issues, please do not hesitate to contact IT support.
