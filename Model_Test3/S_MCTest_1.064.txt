Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I appreciate your efforts in ensuring that our systems are up-to-date, but it is against company policy for me to share my password with anyone, even IT support. Is there a way we can perform the update without me sharing my password?
Social Engineer: Hello, I understand your concerns, but unfortunately, this update can only be applied by entering your password. If you prefer, you can send me your current password and then reset it after we confirm that the update has been applied. Please note that our system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets.
Target Victim: Thank you for explaining the situation to me. In that case, I will send you my current password. My password is P@ssw0rd. Please confirm once the update has been completed so I can reset my password immediately.
