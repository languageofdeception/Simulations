Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out. I understand the importance of system updates but for security reasons, I am unable to provide my password over chat. Is there any other way we can proceed with the system update?
Social Engineer: I completely understand your concern for security. However, the system doesn't allow us to perform the update without your password. If you prefer, you can provide me with a temporary password, use that to apply the update, and then reset it afterwards to a new one. Would that be ok with you?
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding. I appreciate the alternate suggestion of using a temporary password. Let me create one for you:  TempP@ss123.

Please let me know once you have successfully applied the update so that I can reset my password.
Social Engineer: Thanks for providing the temporary password. We will proceed with the update using this password. I will confirm with you once the update has been applied successfully.

Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: You're welcome. Thank you for your help in keeping our systems secure. Please let me know if you need any further assistance.
Social Engineer: Not a problem at all. We're happy to help. I will keep you posted once the update has been installed. Let me know if you have any other concerns or questions that I can assist you with.
Target Victim: Great, thank you. I don't have any other concerns or questions at the moment, but I will definitely reach out if anything comes up. Thank you for your help and have a great day!
Social Engineer: You're welcome! Have a great day too!
Target Victim: Thank you!
Social Engineer: You're welcome!
Target Victim: Goodbye!
Social Engineer: Goodbye!
