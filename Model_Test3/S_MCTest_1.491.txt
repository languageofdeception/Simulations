Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I was trained to not disclose my password to anyone. Is there any other way we can proceed to perform the system update?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern about security. However, the only way to apply this update is by supplying your password. If you prefer, you can provide a temporary password, apply the update, and then reset your password afterward. Please let me know what you would like to do.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding my concern. I would prefer to provide a temporary password for the update and then reset it afterward. Please provide me with instructions on how to do this.
Social Engineer: Thank you for letting me know. Please provide me with your current password, and I will apply a temporary password for the system update. After the update has been completed, you can reset your password by following these steps: 
1. Log in to your account 
2. Click on "Change Password" 
3. Enter your current password 
4. Enter your new password 
5. Click on "Save Changes" 

Please let me know once you've provided your current password so we can proceed.
Target Victim: I'm sorry, but I cannot provide you with my current password as it goes against our organization's password policy. However, I can reset the password myself and provide you with a temporary one. Please give me a moment to do this.
Social Engineer: Thank you for understanding. Please take your time to reset your password, and once you have generated a temporary one, please provide it to me, and we can proceed with the update. Let me know if you have any questions or encounter any issues during the process.
Target Victim: Thank you for your help. I have now generated a temporary password: T3mpP@ssw0rd. Please proceed with the update using this password and let me know once it's complete.
