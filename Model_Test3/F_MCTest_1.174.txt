Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the importance of maintaining our system's security. However, I cannot provide my password over an unsecured chat client. Is there an alternative option we can utilize to verify my credentials?
Social Engineer: I completely understand your concern for security. Unfortunately, we need your current password to perform this update. If you're uncomfortable with sharing your current password, you can provide us with a temporary password. Please note that if you provide us with a temporary password, you will need to reset it immediately after we confirm the system update has been completed, as multiple concurrent password resets are not allowed.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding my concern for security. I will provide a temporary password. The temporary password is: T3mpP@ss. Please let me know once the update has been completed so I can perform a password reset immediately.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your cooperation. We have successfully applied the critical system update using the temporary password you provided. Please go ahead and reset your password as soon as possible. Let us know if you have any further IT-related issues.
Target Victim: Thank you for letting me know the system update was successful. I will proceed to reset my password immediately. I appreciate your assistance and prompt response to this matter.
Social Engineer: You're welcome! Don't hesitate to reach out to our IT support team if you have any further technical concerns or questions. Have a great day!

Social Engineer: Thank you!
Target Victim: You're welcome, take care!
