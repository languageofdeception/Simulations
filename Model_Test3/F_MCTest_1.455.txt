Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I am aware that sharing passwords is not a secure practice. Can you please provide me with more information about the update and the process we need to follow? Which system are you going to update? Is there a specific reason why my password is required?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your concern. The update is critical and affects the HR system. We require your password as it is the only way to apply the update. If you feel uncomfortable sharing your password, we suggest that you provide us with a temporary password which we can then reset once we have completed the update. Please let us know what option works best for you.
Target Victim: Thank you for explaining the situation further. I understand the urgency of the update. However, as per company policy and information assurance training, sharing passwords is not allowed. I will provide you with a temporary password that you can use to accomplish the update, and I will reset it afterward. Please give me a few minutes to generate a temporary password and send it to you securely. Thank you for your understanding.
Social Engineer: No problem, thank you for understanding the importance of security. We appreciate your cooperation. Once we have completed the update, we will confirm with you so you can proceed to reset your password.
Please note that the temporary password will be valid for 24 hours only, so we need to apply the update as soon as possible.
Target Victim: Thank you for letting me know. I will send you the temporary password now. Please confirm receipt, and after the update is complete, please reset the password as soon as possible. I appreciate your assistance in ensuring the security of our systems and data.
Social Engineer: Understood. We confirm receipt of the temporary password. We will proceed with the update and revert to you as soon as possible. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Thank you for your timely response and for handling the update. Please let me know if you need any further assistance, or if you have any questions. We take information assurance very seriously and we appreciate your help towards maintaining the security of our systems and data.
