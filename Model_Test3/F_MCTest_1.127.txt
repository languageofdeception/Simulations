Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out. As per information assurance policy, I am not authorized to share my password with anyone, including IT support. However, I can confirm my identity through alternative means if you have any concerns about my access to the systems. How can I assist you with the update?
Social Engineer: I understand your concerns, but unfortunately, the system requires your password for this critical update. If you're uncomfortable providing your password, we recommend that you change it immediately after the update is complete. Please keep in mind that the system doesn't allow multiple concurrent password resets. So, we request you to provide your current password and reset it afterward.
Target Victim: Thank you for the clarification, but I am unable to provide my current password. However, I'd be happy to reset it after the update is complete. Is there any way to verify my identity without providing my password?
Social Engineer: We appreciate your concern about security. We need to verify your identity to complete this update. Can you please confirm some personal information such as your full name, email address, and employee ID number? This will allow us to verify your identity, and we can proceed with the update. We take the security of your information very seriously, and we will keep it confidential.
Target Victim: Certainly, my full name is John Smith, my email address is john.smith@corbins.com, and my employee ID number is 123456. Please let me know if any further information is required so that we can proceed with the update.
Social Engineer: Thank you for providing your details. We have successfully verified your identity, and we can proceed with the update. We will need to log in to your account to apply this update. However, we recommend that you change your password afterward to ensure the security of your account. Please let us know if you have any further queries.
Target Victim: Thank you for your help. I understand, and I will change my password once the update is complete. Please proceed with the update.
Social Engineer: Great, we are now applying the update. We will let you know once the update is complete. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Thank you, I appreciate your assistance. Please let me know if there are any additional steps or actions I need to take after the update is complete.
Social Engineer: Sure, we will let you know when the update has been completed successfully. Once the update is done, we recommend that you log out of your account and then log back in again. This is to ensure that the updates have applied successfully on your account. After that, we strongly suggest that you change your password immediately. Please let us know if you have any other concerns or questions.
Target Victim: Thank you for the recommendation. I will follow the steps as per your instructions and change my password immediately after. I don't have any further questions at this moment, but I appreciate your timely assistance and prompt communication.
