Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, as per the information assurance policies, I cannot disclose my password or share my login credentials with anyone, including members of the IT helpdesk. However, I am happy to verify my identity through other means or reset my password through the proper channels if needed. Can you please provide more details about the critical system update?
Social Engineer: Hi, I understand your concerns about cybersecurity. We assure you that we follow industry-standard protocols to ensure the safety and security of your information. The critical system update is related to the security of the entire system, and we require your password to apply the update. If you insist on providing a temporary password, you can send your current password and reset it immediately after we confirm that the update has been applied. Please let me know if you agree to this.
Target Victim: I appreciate your explanation and concern for security. However, it is still against company policy to share my password with anyone. Instead, can you guide me through the procedure to reset my password? I am happy to reset it and provide you with the new password.
Social Engineer: Thank you for understanding. I can certainly guide you through the password reset process. Please go to [company website/portal] and click on the "Forgot Password" link. You will be prompted to provide some account verification information and then asked to create a new password. Once you have reset your password, please send me the new password so we can proceed with the critical system update. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Thank you for the instructions. I will proceed with resetting my password and will provide you with the new password once I have completed the process. Thank you for your help and attention to security.
Social Engineer: You're welcome! I appreciate your cooperation and understanding. Please let me know once you have reset your password and provide me with the new one so that we can proceed with the system update as soon as possible.
Target Victim: I have successfully reset my password. My new password is Xyzzy@21#. Please confirm that you have received it before proceeding with the system update.
Social Engineer: Thank you for the new password. I confirm that I have received it. I will proceed with the system update now, and I will notify you once it has been applied. Thank you for your cooperation, diligence, and commitment to company security protocols. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or concerns.
