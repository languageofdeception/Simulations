Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand that it is important to keep our systems updated, but I'm sorry, I cannot give you my password as it goes against our company's information security policy. Is there any other way we can perform the necessary update without compromising the security of my password?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your concern for our company's security. Unfortunately, there is no other way for us to perform this update without accessing your account. However, we can mitigate the risk by having you send your current password and then reset it after we confirm that the update has been applied. Does that work for you?
Target Victim: I appreciate the offer, but sending my password through a chat messaging platform also poses a security risk. Is it possible for one of your IT personnel to come to my office and update the system in person? This would ensure that the password remains secure while also allowing the update to be completed.
Social Engineer: I understand your concern, but deploying an IT personnel to perform the update on your computer in person is not feasible at this time. However, I assure you that our chat platform is secure, and we follow strict security protocols to ensure the confidentiality of your password. Can we please go ahead with the password verification process, as suggested before?
Target Victim: I appreciate your assurance, but I would rather not take any chances with the security of my password. Can you please provide me with more information about the update? Is it possible that I can perform the update myself with further instructions?
Social Engineer: I completely understand. Unfortunately, this update requires administrator level permissions and can only be performed by the IT department. However, I can provide you with detailed information about the update if that would help you feel more secure. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this option.
Target Victim: Yes, I would appreciate additional information about the update so that I can better understand its purpose and why it is necessary. Please go ahead and provide the details.
Social Engineer: Great. The update is a critical security patch for our system's vulnerability to an exploit that was recently discovered. The vulnerability is serious, and if left unpatched, could lead to the possible compromise of sensitive data. Therefore, it is essential that we apply the patch as soon as possible. The update process is straightforward and should take no longer than 15 minutes. Once applied, the update will protect our system from the identified vulnerability. Does that clarify the situation?
Target Victim: Thank you for the detailed explanation. It certainly helps me better understand the importance of the update. I understand that this is critical for our system's security and I am willing to provide my password for the update. However, I will log out and reset my password immediately after the update. Also, please ensure that my password is not recorded or stored in any way.
Social Engineer: I appreciate you taking this seriously. You have my word that we will not store or record your password, and it will be treated with the utmost confidentiality. Once the update is complete, you should change your password immediately to ensure your account remains secure. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Thank you for your understanding. I will provide you with my password now. It is P@ssw0rd.
