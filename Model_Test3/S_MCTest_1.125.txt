Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out. As per our information assurance policies, I am not authorized to share my password over chat. However, I am happy to verify my identity and answer security questions if needed. Can you please provide me with more information on the system update and the reason for needing my password?
Social Engineer: Of course, understood. We're performing an urgent security update that requires your password in order to proceed. Unfortunately, there is no way to apply the update without it. As a reminder, if you prefer, you can provide a temporary password, perform the update, and then reset it afterwards. Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.
Target Victim: Thank you for the explanation. I understand the urgency of the update. In order to verify my identity, can you please provide me with some information that only I would know, such as my employee ID or the date I joined the company? I would prefer to provide a temporary password to perform the update and then reset it afterward.
Social Engineer: Sure, I can confirm your identity using your employee ID which, according to your profile, is 1234. Thank you for verifying that with me. As for the temporary password, please send me your current password and set a new one after we confirm that the update has been applied. Thank you!
Target Victim: I'm sorry, but I cannot provide my current password as it goes against our information security policies to share passwords over chat. However, I would be willing to set a temporary password for you to use to perform the update. Once the update is complete, I will reset my password to a new one. Please let me know if this solution works for you.
Social Engineer: Yes, that solution works for us. Please go ahead and set the temporary password, and we will apply the update. Thank you for your cooperation!
Target Victim: Thank you, here is the temporary password: TempP@ssw0rd123. Please let me know once the update is complete and I will proceed to reset my password to a new one.
