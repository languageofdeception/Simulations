Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out. I understand the importance of system updates, however, I cannot disclose my password as it goes against our company's security policy. Is there any other way I can assist you with this update?
Social Engineer: I completely understand your concerns regarding security. Unfortunately, there is no other way to apply this update without your password. To avoid any inconvenience, would you be willing to provide us with a temporary password and then reset it after you receive confirmation that the update has been applied? Please let me know.
Target Victim: Unfortunately, giving out a temporary password is still a potential security risk. To ensure the security of our systems and the confidentiality of our data, I need you to identify yourself and provide some context for the critical system update before we proceed any further. To verify your identity, may I have your name, department, and employee ID number, please?
Social Engineer: Understood. My name is John Doe from the IT department, and my employee ID number is 12345. The critical system update is related to a security vulnerability that was identified in our system, and we need to apply the patch to prevent any potential security breaches. Your password is required to complete this update, and we ensure you that your password will be kept confidential and will not be shared with anyone outside of our IT department. Can we proceed with this update now?
Target Victim: Thank you for providing your information, John. I appreciate the context and urgency behind this request. I will provide you with my password, which is P@ssw0rd, but please ensure that you change it immediately after updating the system. Also, please confirm with me once the update has been successfully completed. Thank you for your help in keeping our system secure.
