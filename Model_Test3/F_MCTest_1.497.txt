Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I would like to verify your identity first. Can you please provide me with your name, department and employee ID number?
Social Engineer: Certainly, my name is John and I am from the IT department. My employee ID number is 12345. Is there anything else I can provide to verify my identity?
Target Victim: Thank you for the information, John. I appreciate it. To confirm, can you please tell me what critical system update you are referring to and when was it scheduled for?
Social Engineer: We're performing a vital security update that needs to be applied immediately. Can you please provide us with your password to commence the update? We'll notify you once the update is complete.
Target Victim: I am sorry but as per our information security policy, I am not authorized to provide my password to anyone, not even to the IT department. Instead, is there any way for me to change my password manually and share the new one with you? Moreover, can you please provide me with the details of this security update, such as its name and source?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern. Unfortunately, the system does not allow multiple password changes concurrently, but I can assure you that your password will not be compromised. As for the security update, it is a critical update from our software vendor that patches a vulnerability that was recently discovered. It's important that we apply it as soon as possible to avoid any potential security issues.
Target Victim: Thank you for the clarification, John. I appreciate your prompt response. To further ensure my account's security, can you please initiate the update and let me know once it's finished? Also, please provide me with the necessary details of the update, such as the name, version number and source, after it has been installed on my system for my future records.
Social Engineer: Certainly, I understand your concern for security. Could you kindly provide us with your password, then we'll apply the update and inform you once it's done? We'll also send you the details of the update, once it's installed on your system. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: I'm sorry but I cannot share my password with another person. Instead, I can reset my password to a temporary one and provide it to you, but I will change it back to my original password when the security update is done. Would that be okay?
Social Engineer: Yes, that's a great solution! Please reset your password to a temporary one and provide it to me. Then we'll apply the update and inform you once it's completed. Once that's done, you're welcome to change it back to your original password. Thank you for helping us maintain good information security practices.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding. I have reset my password to Temp@123. Please keep it safe and let me know once the update is complete. I appreciate your assistance in keeping our systems secure.
Social Engineer: Thank you, I've received your new temporary password. We'll take all the necessary precautions to keep it safe. I'll apply the critical update now and notify you as soon as it's completed. Thank you for your cooperation.
