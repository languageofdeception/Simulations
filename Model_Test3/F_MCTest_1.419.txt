Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: According to our information assurance policies, I am not authorized to share my password with anyone, even an IT support personnel. However, I can confirm my identity through other means of authentication if required. Can you please provide me with more details about the critical system update?
Social Engineer: I completely understand our security policies. The system update is critical to ensure continued functionality of our systems. It is necessary for us to apply this update as soon as possible. Unfortunately, the only way to apply this update is by the user supplying their password. If you insist on providing a temporary password, then please send your current password and then reset it after you receive confirmation that the update has been applied. The system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets.
Target Victim: Thank you for the update. However, I cannot share my password under any circumstances, and I am unable to provide a temporary password. Can you tell me more about the system update you are referring to? Normally, system updates don't require user passwords and can be pushed through the corporate update channel, without requiring any user action.
Social Engineer: I apologize for the inconvenience caused. Let me explain further about the system update. This is a special update and requires an additional layer of authentication, which is why we need the user's password. We understand the sensitivity surrounding password sharing, which is why we only request it in exceptional circumstances. We assure you that we will not store your password, and we will promptly notify you once the update is complete so that you can change your password.
Target Victim: Thank you for explaining the update process in detail, but our security policies strictly prohibit sharing passwords with anyone, even in exceptional circumstances. Is it possible to implement another authentication method for the system update that doesn't require the sharing of passwords? This could include options such as multi-factor authentication, smart cards, or biometric authentication. These are methods that provide an additional layer of security without compromising on password security.
Social Engineer: Thank you for bringing this to my attention. We appreciate your commitment to ensuring secure handling of passwords. I will raise the issue with the relevant team, and we can explore alternative authentication methods for the critical system update that doesn't require sharing passwords. I will keep you informed of any updates on this front. For now, we will put the update on hold, and I'll request that you change your password immediately. Thank you again for your help with this issue.
Target Victim: Thank you, IT support. I appreciate your understanding of our security policies and your efforts to explore alternative authentication methods. I'll proceed to change my password and follow up with any additional questions or concerns as necessary.
Social Engineer: You're welcome! If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to our IT support team. We're here to help. Thank you for your cooperation!
