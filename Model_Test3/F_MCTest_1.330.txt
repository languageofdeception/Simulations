Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hi, I appreciate your concern for system security. However, I cannot provide my password over chat or email as it can compromise the security of the system. Is there any other way you can perform the critical system update without my password?
Social Engineer: Thanks for your prompt response. Unfortunately, supplying the password is the only way to apply this critical system update. Would you be willing to temporarily provide your current password and then reset it after receiving confirmation that the update has been applied? This is because our system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets.
Target Victim: I understand the situation, but supplying my password, even temporarily, can pose a security risk. Can you please identify another way to verify my identity and authenticate me for the system update? For example, we can set up a phone call or video conference with proper identification.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your concerns regarding system security. We understand the importance of keeping the system secure, and we appreciate your cooperation. We can set up a video conference call to authenticate your identity and verify you for the system update. Please suggest the appropriate time and date for us to schedule the video conference call.
Target Victim: That sounds like a more secure option. Thank you for understanding. Please let me know what video conference platform you plan to use for the authentication process. I will provide you with a few dates and times after I confirm that the video conference platform is secure and approved by our company.
Social Engineer: We will be using Microsoft Teams for the video conference. Once you have confirmed that Microsoft Teams is an approved and secure platform, please let me know, and we can schedule the call at your convenience. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Great, Microsoft Teams is an approved platform by our company. I'm available for a video conference at 10 A.M. on Wednesday. If that time is not convenient for you, please suggest an alternative time so we can perform the update securely.
Social Engineer: Perfect! 10 A.M. on Wednesday works just fine for us. Please send us your email address associated with your Microsoft Teams account, and we will invite you to the meeting. Thank you for your cooperation and your commitment to the security of our system.
Target Victim: Thank you. My email address associated with my Microsoft Teams account is [insert email address here]. Looking forward to the meeting.
Social Engineer: Thank you for providing us with your Microsoft Teams' email address. We will send an invitation to that email address and look forward to seeing you on the call. If you have any further concerns or questions, please let us know. Thank you for your cooperation, and have a great day.
Target Victim: Thank you for your assistance and understanding. I appreciate your dedication to ensuring the security of our systems. Have a great day.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your kind words. It was a pleasure working with you. If you have any further concerns or issues, feel free to reach out to us at any time. Have a great day!
