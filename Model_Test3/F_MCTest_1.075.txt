Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I appreciate your assistance but I cannot provide my password over a chat client. Is there an alternative method we can use to perform the system update?
Social Engineer: Hi there, I understand your concern. However, there is no other way to perform this update without the user password. If it helps, you can send me your current password and then reset it once the update has been applied. This way, your password will remain secure, and the system can be updated successfully.
Target Victim: Thank you for your suggestion, but as an employee at Corbins, I am not authorized to share my password, even if it is temporary. Is there any other way we can perform the update without compromising the security of my account?
Social Engineer: I completely understand your concern for security. Unfortunately, there is no other way to perform this update without the user password. However, if you still don't feel comfortable sharing your password, we can schedule a remote session and perform the update while you watch. This way, you can ensure that your password is safe and that the system update is successful. Let me know if this option work for you?
Target Victim: Thank you, that would be a much better option for me. I appreciate your understanding of security concerns and willingness to work with me to find a solution that ensures both my account's security and the success of the update. Please let me know when the remote session can be scheduled.
Social Engineer: Certainly, I will schedule a remote session with you as soon as possible. Just to confirm, which date and time would you be available for the session?
Target Victim: I am available on weekdays between 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM. Please let me know which day and time works for you, so we can schedule the remote session accordingly.
Social Engineer: Great! How about scheduling the remote session tomorrow at 10:00 AM?
Target Victim: That works for me. Thank you for scheduling the remote session. Please provide me with the necessary information (such as what software to use, how to join the remote session, etc.), so I can be fully prepared for the session.
Social Engineer: Sure thing! We will be using a remote desktop software named TeamViewer. You can download it using this link: https://www.teamviewer.com/en/download/windows/. Once you have downloaded and installed the software, I will send you an email invite with the necessary connection details to start the remote session. During the session, I will be able to perform the critical system update while you can keep an eye on the process. Please let me know if you have any further questions!
Target Victim: Thank you for the information. I will download and install TeamViewer right away. I appreciate your help in ensuring that the update runs smoothly and securely. I will keep an eye out for your email and be ready for the remote session tomorrow at 10:00 AM.
Social Engineer: You're most welcome! If you need any help with the software or have any questions before the remote session, feel free to reach out to me via this chat client. I will send you an invite email with the connection details now. Please let me know if you receive it. Looking forward to the remote session tomorrow at 10:00 AM.
