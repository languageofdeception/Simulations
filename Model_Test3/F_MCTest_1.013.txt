Target Victim: Hello, I understand the importance of system updates, but for security reasons, I cannot provide my password over chat. Can you please provide me with more information about the update, so I can verify that it is legitimate?
Social Engineer: Sure, we are performing a security patch that requires your password to complete the process. Unfortunately, there is no other way to apply the update. If youâ€™re uncomfortable sharing your current password, please change it after the update has been applied. Is it Alright for me to procced?
