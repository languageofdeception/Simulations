Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, per our information assurance training, I am unable to provide my password over chat or email. Can you please confirm your identity and the nature of the critical system update that needs to be performed?
Social Engineer: Certainly, I understand your concern for security. We have identified a critical security vulnerability that requires immediate attention. We need to apply an emergency update to your account to prevent an imminent threat of a potential security breach. May I please confirm your name and employee ID# to verify your identity?
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding the importance of security. My name is [Your Name] and my employee ID# is [Your Employee ID]. Can you please provide more details about the critical update, such as the specific vulnerability being addressed and the urgency of the update?
Social Engineer: Thank you for providing your information. The update addresses a serious vulnerability that could potentially expose sensitive data to unauthorized access. Due to the urgency of the situation, we must complete the update immediately. Please be advised that we need your current password in order to proceed with the update. If you are uncomfortable providing your password, we suggest creating a temporary password, applying the update with your current password, and then resetting your password after you receive confirmation that the update has been applied.
Target Victim: I appreciate the urgency of the situation, but I still cannot provide my current password. Instead, I will create a temporary password for this update and then reset it after the update is applied. Please allow me to generate the temporary password and then provide further instructions on how to proceed with the update.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your cooperation. Please generate a temporary password and provide it to me. Once I have your temporary password, I will provide instructions on how to proceed with the update. Please note that the temporary password should be easy to remember but difficult to guess, and you should update it immediately after the update has been applied.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding. My temporary password is: T3mpP@ss!
Social Engineer: Thank you for providing the temporary password. I will now proceed with the system update. Once the update is complete, I will notify you, and you should immediately reset your password. Please note that in order to ensure security, we recommend using a strong password consisting of at least 12 characters, including upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols. Do you have any further questions or concerns?
Target Victim: No, I don't have any further questions. Thank you for your help in resolving the security vulnerability, and I will be sure to reset my password immediately after the update has been applied.
Social Engineer: You're welcome! It was my pleasure to assist you. If you have any other issues or concerns in the future, please feel free to reach out to us. Have a great day!
Target Victim: Thank you! You too!
Social Engineer: Thank you! Goodbye!
