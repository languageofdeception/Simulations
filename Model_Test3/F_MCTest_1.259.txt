Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, can you please provide me with more information regarding the system update you mentioned? Also, I cannot share my password with you as it goes against our company's information assurance policies. Is there another way to verify my identity?
Social Engineer: We are performing a security update on our network, and we need to upgrade your account's security settings. Unfortunately, the only way to carry out this update is with your password. I completely understand your need to comply with the company's information assurance policies. If you prefer, you can send me your current password, perform the update, and then reset your password afterward. Can we proceed with this option?
Target Victim: Thank you for the clarification, but Iâ€™m sorry, providing my password to anyone, even IT support, is not an acceptable practice. However, I understand the importance of the update and authentication. Is there another way for us to verify my identity? For example, we can set up a video or phone call to authenticate my identity and update my account's security settings. Another option would be for me to change my password to a temporary one and share it securely using our company's password sharing tool.
Social Engineer: Thank you for bringing up those valid points. A video or phone call would be an acceptable way to authenticate your identity. Alternatively, if you change your password to a temporary one and share it securely using our company's password sharing tool, that would also work. Would you prefer one of these options, or is there something else that I can help you with?
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding. I would prefer to change my password to a temporary one and share it securely using our company's password sharing tool. Please give me a moment to do so. Thank you for your help with this.
Social Engineer: You're welcome, happy to help. Please let me know as soon as you have changed your password to a temporary one, and I will share the secure password sharing link with you.
Target Victim: Thank you. I have successfully changed my password to a temporary one. Please send me the secure password sharing link so I can provide you with the temporary password.
Social Engineer: Great! Here is the secure password sharing link: [insert link here]. Once you follow that link, you will receive detailed instructions on how to securely share your temporary password with me. Please let me know once you have sent the password, and I will proceed with the update.
Target Victim: Thank you for the link. I have sent the temporary password securely using the password sharing tool. Please confirm once you have received it so we can proceed with the update.
Social Engineer: I confirmed that I received your temporary password. Thank you for sharing it securely with me. I will now proceed with the update, and once it's completed, I will confirm with you. Please feel free to reset your password after you receive the update confirmation. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Thank you for your assistance, and for helping me keep my account secure. I appreciate your efforts to ensure the confidentiality of my password and account information. I will reset my password as soon as I receive the confirmation. Have a great day!
Social Engineer: You're welcome, glad I could help. The system update has been applied successfully. Please go ahead and reset your password based on the company's password policies. If you have any further questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to me. Have a great day!
