Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, in accordance with information assurance practices, I cannot provide my password to anyone, even IT support personnel. Is there any other way we can perform the critical system update?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern, but unfortunately, there is no other way to apply this update. However, if you'd like, you can send me a temporary password that we can use to apply this update. Once the update is confirmed, you can reset your password.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding. I appreciate your suggestion to send a temporary password. I will send a temporary password to your email for this purpose. Please let me know once you have completed the update, and I will reset my password immediately for security reasons.
Social Engineer: Thank you. I have received your email with the temporary password. I will update the system, and once it's confirmed, I will notify you. Please reset your password as soon as you receive the confirmation to ensure the security of your account.
