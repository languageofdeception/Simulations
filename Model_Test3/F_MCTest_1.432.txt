Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the need for a critical system update, but I cannot provide you with my password for security reasons. May I know what kind of update you are performing and how it will affect my work?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your concern regarding security. The update is essential to fix a bug that may cause significant issues with our services. It should not take long and will not affect your work in any way. If possible, please provide your password so we can proceed with the update. If you're uncomfortable sharing it, please reset it immediately following the update.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing me with more details about the update. However, for security reasons, I cannot provide my password to anyone, even if it's for system maintenance purposes. Is there any other way we can proceed with the update without compromising account security?
Social Engineer: I understand your concerns regarding sharing passwords. Unfortunately, we cannot perform the update without your password. However, I suggest you temporarily change your password to something easy to remember and share it with me. Once the update is complete, please reset it again to a secure password. This way, you can maintain the security of your account while allowing us the necessary access to perform the update. Please let me know if you're comfortable with this solution.
Target Victim: Thank you for your suggestion, but I cannot compromise the security of my account in any way. Instead, could you please send me an email from your company email ID with the details of the update? I will be able to verify the information with the relevant department and share my approval for the update if required.
Social Engineer: I understand. Let me check if I can send you an email regarding the update. Please wait for a while.
Target Victim: Sure, I can wait while you verify the information. Thank you for understanding my concern for security.
Social Engineer: Thank you for waiting. I am unable to send you an email from our company's email ID due to security protocols. However, I assure you that this update is necessary and time-sensitive. Could you please share your concerns, and I'll try my level best to provide you with as much information as possible?
Target Victim: I completely understand the importance of the update, but my concern is regarding the sharing of a password even if temporarily. In place of the password, could you please provide me with a secure token or passphrase that I can use to authenticate myself during the update process? This will ensure that my account security is not compromised while allowing the update to proceed.
Social Engineer: I apologize for any inconvenience caused by our initial request. Unfortunately, we don't have a token or passphrase mechanism in place. However, I seek your permission to escalate this issue to our superiors, and we shall get back to you shortly with an effective solution.
Target Victim: Yes, please, feel free to escalate this issue. I appreciate your effort in finding a solution that meets both the requirement for the system update and my security concerns. Please keep me updated on the progress and let me know if any further action is required from my end. Thank you for your help.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your cooperation. I will escalate this issue to our superiors and ensure that you're informed of the progress. Please let me know if there is anything else I can assist you with.
