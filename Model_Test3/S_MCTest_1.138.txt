Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand that you require my password for the system update, but I cannot disclose it over an unsecured communication channel such as chat. Can you please explain the procedure and provide me with further details on the system update? Also, can you kindly confirm your identity and provide your employee ID? This is to ensure that I am providing my password to an authorized person.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your concern about security. We take it seriously as well. I am a verified member of the IT helpdesk team at Corbins, and my employee ID is 12345. The system is in need of an important update which requires users to supply their password to complete the process. We understand your concern about sharing your password and suggest you to change it immediately after the update. Could you please confirm if you are willing to temporarily share your current password for the update?
Target Victim: Thank you for verifying your identity and explaining the situation. I understand that the update is critical and important for the security of the system, and I am willing to temporarily share my password for the update process. However, I will change my password as soon as the update is complete to ensure the confidentiality and security of my account. My current password is P@ssw0rd. Please let me know if there is anything else I can assist you with.
