Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I appreciate your efforts to help with the system update. However, I cannot disclose my password over chat as it is a violation of our company's information assurance policy. Is there any other way to proceed with the update?
Social Engineer: Thank you for letting me know. Unfortunately, we need your password to apply the update as this is the only way to do it. If you're hesitant in giving away your current password, can you please change your password to something temporary, send me that temporary password, and then change it again once the update has been successfully applied? Please let me know your preference so we can proceed accordingly.
Target Victim: I understand the need for the password for the system update. Changing my password temporarily seems like a reasonable approach. I will change my password to a temporary one and share it with you. However, I will change it back to my original password right after the update is complete. 

Here is my temporary password: TempP@ssw0rd. Let me know when the update is complete, so I can change my password back to my original.
