Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out. Before I provide my password, can you please confirm your identity and purpose of the critical system update? This is to ensure the security and confidentiality of my account and company data.
Social Engineer: Absolutely, my name is [Your Name] and I am an IT helpdesk technician at Corbins. The purpose of the critical system update is to maintain the security and stability of our systems. Can you please provide your password so we can proceed with the update?
Target Victim: Thank you for your response [Your Name]. I appreciate your concern for our security and stability. To ensure compliance with our security policies, I cannot provide my password over chat. However, I can reset my password and provide the new one to you if that is required for the update. Alternatively, we can use a remote assistance tool to allow you to perform the update without revealing my password.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your cooperation. Unfortunately, our system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets, so resetting your password would not be feasible at this time. We do not use any remote assistance tools for security reasons, but we assure you that we have taken all necessary measures to protect your system and data. However, we cannot proceed with the update without your current password. We recommend that you reset your password after we confirm the update has been applied successfully.
Target Victim: I appreciate your explanation, but I cannot disclose my password for any reason. As a reminder, sharing passwords is a violation of our security policies and puts our company data at risk. Is there an alternative way to authenticate my account and complete the update without sharing my password?
Social Engineer: Understood. We take our clients' security very seriously, and we appreciate you reminding us of our policies. We will explore other options to update your account without disclosing your password. Please hold on while we investigate this matter.
Target Victim: Thank you, I appreciate your assistance. Please let me know if there is anything I can provide to help with this process.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your patience. We have found a solution that does not involve revealing your password. We can authenticate your account using our multifactor authentication system. To proceed, we will send a verification code to your contact number or email address, which you can reply back to us and we will use this code to authenticate your account. Please let me know which method of contact you would prefer, and we will proceed with the update.
Target Victim: That sounds like a viable solution. I would prefer to receive the verification code via my contact number. Please let me know how I can proceed.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your preference. Please provide your phone number, and we will send a verification code to your phone within the next 5 minutes. Once you receive the code, please reply back with the code to authenticate your account. We appreciate your cooperation in this matter.
Target Victim: Sure, my phone number is (xxx) xxx-xxxx. Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
Social Engineer: Thank you. We have sent the verification code to your phone number. Please reply back with the code so we can authenticate your account and proceed with the update.
