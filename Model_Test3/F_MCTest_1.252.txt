Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hi, I need to verify your identity first before sharing my password. Can you please provide me with your name and employee ID?
Social Engineer: Of course, I understand the need for security. My name is John Smith and my employee ID is 12345. Would you mind providing me with your password so we can apply this critical system update?
Target Victim: I'm sorry, but I am unable to provide my password to you. As per our company's information assurance policies, passwords should never be shared with anyone, including IT support. Can you please provide me with the specific system update you are performing and how it will affect my work? And, if necessary, I can change my password after the update is completed.
Social Engineer: I completely understand the importance of password security. We are performing a critical security update that requires the user's password to be entered for authentication purposes. This update will help improve the overall security of our systems and protect against potential threats. If you would like, you can send me your current password and then reset it after we have confirmed that the update has been applied. Thank you.
Target Victim: I appreciate your explanation of the situation. However, I still cannot provide my password to you. Instead, I suggest we follow our company's standard protocol for performing such updates. I will log in to the system myself and initiate the process for the update if necessary. This will allow me to ensure the authenticity and reliability of the update process, while also upholding our company's security standards. Thank you for understanding.
Social Engineer: I appreciate your concern for security. Unfortunately, in this case, the only way to apply the update is by entering the user's password. As a workaround, you can provide a temporary password, if you choose to do so, and immediately reset the password after we confirm that the update has been successfully installed. Please note that the system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets. Let me know how you would like to proceed.
Target Victim: I understand your explanation, but I am feeling hesitant to provide my password even temporarily. Instead, I would like to propose an alternative solution. Can you please create a temporary password for me and provide it to me via a secure channel (e.g. encrypted email)? I will use the temporary password to authenticate when prompted during the update process, and immediately after the update is completed, I will reset my password to a new one. This way, my password will not be disclosed to anyone and our company's security standards will be upheld. Would that be possible?
Social Engineer: I understand your concerns, and will be happy to create a temporary password for you. However, please note that it is not safe for me as an IT support technician to generate passwords, as that could be viewed as a breach of security. Instead, I recommend that you go through the regular password reset process which will generate an automatic and random temporary password for you. This temporary password will be communicated to you via a secure channel. Using this temporary password, you can access the system and enter this password when prompted during the update process. After completion of the update process, you can then reset your password to a new one.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding my concerns. Your suggestion seems to be a secure and effective way to proceed with the update. I will follow your recommended process for resetting my password, and then update the necessary systems with the temporary password provided. Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
