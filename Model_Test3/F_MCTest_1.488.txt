Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, can you please provide me with your name and employee ID for verification purposes? Additionally, I would like to confirm that a critical system update is scheduled to be performed. As a reminder, I cannot disclose my password over chat for security reasons.
Social Engineer: Absolutely, my name is [Your Name] and my employee ID is [Your ID Number]. The critical system update is scheduled to be performed urgently, and it requires your password to proceed. For security reasons, we recommend that you send your current password in the chat and reset it immediately after we confirm the update has been applied. Alternatively, we can schedule a time for remote assistance to apply the update together.
