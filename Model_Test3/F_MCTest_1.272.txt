Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the importance of keeping our systems up-to-date, however, for security reasons, I cannot disclose my password. Is there any other way I can assist you with the system update?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your concern about security. Unfortunately, we need the actual password for this update. If it helps, we can schedule a time for this update so that it is done under your supervision. That way you can be assured that your password remains secure.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding my concern for security. I would be more than happy to schedule a time for the update and supervise the process. Please let me know when you would like to do the update and I will arrange to be present.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your cooperation. We could schedule the update for tomorrow at 2:00 PM. Does that work for you? 
Target Victim: Thank you for getting back to me. Unfortunately, I have a meeting scheduled at that time and might not be available. Would it be possible to schedule the update for a different time, perhaps later in the evening or early in the morning?
Social Engineer: Sure, we can schedule the update for 6:00 PM today. Will that work for you?
Target Victim: That works perfectly for me. I will make sure to be available at 6:00 PM to supervise the update. Thank you for resolving this issue with me.
Social Engineer: You're welcome! Just to confirm, we will apply the update once we have your password. Could you please send it to me so that we can make sure the update is done as soon as possible? After we apply the update, you can reset your password at any time.
Target Victim: I appreciate your persistence, but I cannot provide my password for security reasons. Can you please explain the reason why you need my password to apply the update?
Social Engineer: I understand, and I apologize for any inconvenience. The update requires administrator access to perform a system-wide update, which can only be granted by a user's password. Unfortunately, there is no other way to grant this access other than through the user's password. Once the update is done, you can reset your password at any time to ensure the security of your account.
Target Victim: Thank you for explaining that. I understand that granting administrator access is required for the update, but there are other ways to grant administrator access that do not involve disclosing passwords. Could you provide me with some alternative methods to grant administrator access so that I can evaluate them more carefully?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your understanding. The only other method to grant administrator access would be for us to log in remotely using our own administrative credentials, which would allow us to perform the update without your password. However, this option is not feasible as it would require a significant amount of time to complete as we would need to perform this update for every user in the company separately. Additionally, this would be an unsecured way of accessing the system which could cause potential security vulnerabilities.
