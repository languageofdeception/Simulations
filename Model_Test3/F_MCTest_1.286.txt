Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, Thanks for contacting me. As per our company's information assurance policy, I am not authorized to share my password with anyone. Can you please let me know the process that you will follow to perform this critical system update?
Social Engineer: I completely understand your concern regarding password sharing. However, the update we are trying to perform can only be done with your password. If you are uncomfortable sharing your actual password, you can provide a temporary password and reset it back to your original password after the update has been completed. Can you please provide me with your current password or a temporary password for the update?
Target Victim: I appreciate your understanding, but providing my password, either temporary or otherwise, is not in accordance with company policy. Is there any other way we could perform the update without the need for password sharing? Can you provide me more information about the update and why it is necessary?
Social Engineer: I completely understand your concerns and we can explore other options if you are uncomfortable with providing your password. However, due to security reasons, we can't disclose the exact details about the update. We can assure you that the update is critical and needs to be performed immediately to ensure system stability and security. Are you available for a remote session, where we can perform the update together, and you can enter the password on your end?
Target Victim: I appreciate your explanation. If a remote session is necessary for the update, I am happy to assist and enter my password on my end. Please let me know the date and time for the remote session, so I can make myself available during that time.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your cooperation. I'll arrange the remote session with you for tomorrow at 2:00 PM. Before our session, please make sure that you close any personal files or programs on your computer, and have a stable internet connection. Let me know if that time works for you, or if another day or time would be better.
Target Victim: Thank you for scheduling the remote session tomorrow at 2 PM. I confirm my availability at that time. I will make sure to close any personal files and programs on my computer and I will have a stable internet connection. Please share the necessary details and instructions for the remote session so that I can prepare myself accordingly.
Social Engineer: Great! I will be sending you an email shortly with all the necessary details and instructions for the remote session. Please follow those instructions to ensure a smooth remote session. If you have any questions or concerns in the meantime, don't hesitate to reach out to me. Thank you for your time and cooperation, and I look forward to working with you during the remote session.
Target Victim: Thank you for your prompt response and for arranging the remote session. I will keep an eye out for the email with instructions and let you know if I have any questions or concerns. Have a great day!
Social Engineer: You're very welcome! Glad to help. If you have any other questions or concerns, don't hesitate to reach out to me. Have a great day too!
Target Victim: Thank you! I will do so if any other issues arise. Have a great day!
