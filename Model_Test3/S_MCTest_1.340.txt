Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I was advised by my information assurance training to never share my password over chat. Is there any other information or verification method I can provide to assist with the critical system update?
Social Engineer: I completely understand your concern, but unfortunately, the only way for us to perform the update is by using your password. We assure you that your privacy and security are our top priority, and once the update is complete, you can reset your password to ensure your account's security. Alternatively, you can provide a temporary password, and then reset it after we have applied the update. Please let me know how you would like to proceed.
Target Victim: I appreciate your explanation, but according to Corbins' security policy, I am not authorized to give my password to anyone. However, to confirm that you are part of the IT helpdesk team, can you please provide me with your name and employee ID so I can verify your identity? Alternatively, can you please provide me with the reason for the critical system update and the expected duration of the update process? This way, I can ensure the legitimacy of the request and provide any assistance necessary to complete the update.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your understanding. My name is John Smith, and my employee ID is 123456. The critical system update is to patch a vulnerability that has been identified in our system's security. The update should take approximately 30 minutes to complete, during which time you will not be able to access the system. Once the update is complete, we will notify you and provide any necessary instructions to reset your password. Please let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
Target Victim: Thank you, John. I have successfully verified your identity, and I appreciate you explaining the reasons for the update and the expected duration. With this information, I would gladly provide my password to you for the update. My password is P@ssw0rd. Please notify me as soon as the update is completed so I can reset my password and ensure that my account is secure.
