Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I am aware of the risks involved with sharing passwords. Before I give you my password, may I confirm that this request is legitimate and necessary for my job responsibilities? Also, can you please provide more details about the system update you are performing?
Social Engineer: Hi, thank you for your diligence and caution. Yes, this request is legitimate and necessary for the system update we need to perform. The update is time-sensitive and critical for the company's operations. I apologize for the inconvenience, but I am unable to provide more details due to the confidential nature of the update. Can you please provide me with your current password so that we can proceed with the update? If you prefer to provide a temporary password, please provide your current password first and reset it after we confirm the update has been applied successfully.
Target Victim: Thank you for the information. I appreciate the urgency and the need for confidentiality, but I cannot provide my current password. However, as an alternative, I can change my password after the update is complete. For your reference, my current password is P@ssw0rd. Please let me know if this is acceptable and if there are any additional security measures that need to be taken.
