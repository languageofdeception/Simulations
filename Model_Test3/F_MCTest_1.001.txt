Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out. I'm sorry, but I cannot provide you with my password as that goes against Corbins' information assurance policies. Can you please provide me with more details regarding the critical system update you mentioned?
Social Engineer: Absolutely. We need your password to apply a critical update to your system. Unfortunately, our system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets, so we suggest sending your current password and resetting it after you receive confirmation that the update has been applied. Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.
Target Victim: Thank you for the explanation. However, I am still not comfortable providing my password as it is against Corbins' information assurance policies to share passwords. Is it possible for us to perform the critical system update without sharing passwords? Perhaps we can perform the update using a different method or have a supervisor authorize the update.
Social Engineer: Thank you for bringing this to my attention. Unfortunately, we require the password to perform this particular update as it is the only possible way. Our IT team has already received approval from management to perform this update, but we understand your concerns and will look for alternative solutions moving forward. Please let us know if you change your mind in regards to providing your password. Thank you.
Target Victim: I appreciate your understanding and commitment to information assurance. However, in accordance with Corbins' policies, I cannot provide my password as it would compromise both my personal and the company's security. Is there any way we can perform this critical system update without sharing passwords? I would be willing to work with you to find an alternative solution.
Social Engineer: I understand your concerns about sharing passwords and we appreciate your commitment to information security, as it is Corbins' top priority as well. We will be looking into alternative methods to perform this update and I'll be sure to keep you informed if we find a safer, alternative route. Thank you for your cooperation and understanding in this matter.
Target Victim: Thank you for considering an alternative solution for this update. I am glad that we were able to find a resolution that aligns with Corbins' information assurance policies. If there are any updates or further actions required on my end, please don't hesitate to reach out.
