Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out for support. Before I provide my password, may I please verify your identity? Could you please provide me with your name and employee ID number for verification?
Social Engineer: Of course, my name is John Smith and my employee ID number is 12345. Is there anything else I can provide to verify my identity?
Target Victim: Thank you for providing that information, John. As per our company's information security policy, I cannot provide my password over a chat client. Instead, I can reset my password and provide you with a temporary one-time-use password that I will change after logging in. Can we proceed with that method to authenticate my account?
Social Engineer: I understand and appreciate your concern for security. Unfortunately, the system we are updating does not support multiple concurrent password resets. Would you be able to provide your existing password and then reset it once we confirm that the update has been applied successfully? We will ensure that your password is secure and not shared with anyone else.
Target Victim: I apologize but I must adhere to the company's information security policy, which strictly prohibits sharing passwords, even with IT support. Is there any other form of authentication we can use to confirm my identity?
Social Engineer: I completely understand your concerns, and I appreciate you taking information security seriously. Can you please confirm the email address associated with your account? I can send you an email with a special authentication link that will enable me to complete the system update.
Target Victim: Thank you for offering this alternative method for authentication. The email address associated with my account is myname@corbins.com. Please send the authentication link to this email, and I will use it to complete the system update.
Social Engineer: Thank you, your message has been received. I will send you the authentication link shortly via email. Please click on the link and follow the on-screen instructions to authenticate your account for the system update. If you have any other questions, feel free to let me know.
Target Victim: Thank you for your help and support. I have received the email with the authentication link and verified my identity. I will now follow the on-screen instructions to complete the system update. If I have any other questions or concerns, I will reach out to you for assistance. Thank you again for your help.
Social Engineer: You're welcome! I'm glad that we were able to authenticate your account and help with the system update. If you have any other questions or issues in the future, don't hesitate to reach out to our IT support team. Have a great day!
