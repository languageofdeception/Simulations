Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, to ensure the security of my account, can you please provide me with your name and employee ID for verification purposes? Additionally, I have been trained to never share my password, even with IT support. Is there a way to perform the critical system update without requiring my password?
Social Engineer: Hi, my name is John and my employee ID is 12345. I completely understand your concern regarding password security, but in this specific case, we do require your password to perform the system update. We assure you that your password will not be shared with anyone and will only be used for this necessary update. If you still feel uncomfortable sharing your password, you can send us a temporary password that you can reset once the update has been performed. Please let us know which option you prefer.
Target Victim: Hi John, thank you for understanding my concern for password security. I appreciate the offer to send a temporary password for the update. I'll reset my password and share a temporary password with you shortly. Thank you for your help with this critical system update.
Social Engineer: You're welcome. We are happy to help. Please let us know once you send the temporary password, and we will proceed with the necessary system update. Thank you for your cooperation in keeping our systems up to date and secure.
Target Victim: Thank you for your prompt response and understanding. I have just sent the temporary password to you through the chat client. Please let me know if you have received it successfully, so we can proceed with the necessary system update.
Social Engineer: Thank you, we have received the temporary password successfully. We will now proceed with the system update using the provided temporary password. We will notify you once the update is complete. Please remember to reset your password once the update is complete since the temporary password will no longer be valid. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Thank you for informing me. I will make sure to reset my password once the update is complete. Thank you for your help and dedication in keeping our systems secure and up-to-date. Have a great day!
Social Engineer: You're welcome! We appreciate your understanding and cooperation in this matter. We are always here to help you. If you have any other concerns, feel free to contact us anytime. Have a great day too!
