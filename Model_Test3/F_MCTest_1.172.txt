Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, before I provide my password, may I please verify your identity? What is your name and what department are you from?
Social Engineer: Hi, I understand your concern for security. My name is [Your Name], and I work in the IT helpdesk support team at Corbins. Would you mind providing me with your password so we can apply the critical system update?
Target Victim: Thank you for your response, [Your Name]. I appreciate your understanding of security concerns. However, as per the password policy of Corbins, I am not allowed to share my password with anyone, including IT support. 

If you need access to my account for the purpose of system update, I suggest resetting my password, and providing me with a temporary one-time password that I can change after login. 

Please let me know if this is feasible, and we can proceed accordingly.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your response. I understand your concern about password security, and I appreciate your suggestion. However, the system update requires your current password to apply the necessary changes and cannot be completed with a temporary password. 

I assure you that we take the security of your password seriously, and we will not store or misuse your password in any way. Also, I want to mention that the password policy of Corbins requires that you change your password every 90 days for security reasons.

If it's not possible for you to share your password, please let me know, and we will look for an alternative solution.
Target Victim: Thank you for the clarification and your assurance, [Your Name]. I appreciate your effort to secure my password. 

However, for security reasons, I cannot provide my password to anyone, not even IT support, to avoid any possible security breaches. 

I suggest we find an alternative solution. Can you please provide more details about the system update you need to perform so that I can confirm whether it involves my account or not? We can work together to identify a solution that ensures both security and successful completion of the system update.
Social Engineer: Thank you for the feedback, [User Name]. I understand your concern and acknowledge that password security is paramount. Unfortunately, the system update requires your password, and we cannot proceed without it.

The system update involves upgrading the firewall and security settings for our organization's servers, and it affects all user accounts, including yours. The upgrade is necessary to prevent any possible security breaches and ensure that your data is secure.

We have multi-level security measures in place, and you can be assured that we take all necessary precautions to ensure your data's security. However, if you are still uncomfortable sharing your password, we suggest you reset your password and then send it to us securely. You can change your password after the update is complete.

Please let me know if this is possible, and we can proceed with the necessary steps.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing further details about the nature of the system update. I understand the importance of upgrading the firewall and security settings for our organization's servers, and I appreciate your efforts to ensure the security of the system.

Based on the information you have provided, I am willing to reset my password and then share it with you securely. Please let me know the necessary steps I should follow to reset my password and send it securely so that we can proceed with the system update.

Also, please confirm the secure method of sharing my newly reset password, and I will make sure to change it immediately after the system update is complete. Thank you for your support and understanding.
