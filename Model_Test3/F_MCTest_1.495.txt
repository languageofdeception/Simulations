Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for contacting me. As per our company's information assurance policy, I am unable to provide my password, even for critical system updates. Is there another way we can perform the update?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern, however, I'm afraid that it's the only way to apply the update. If you're not comfortable sharing your current password, please provide me with a temporary password, and you can change it once the update has been applied.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding. In that case, please provide me the necessary steps to change my password once the update has been applied. I can provide you with a temporary password: [temporarypassword]. Please let me know once the update has been completed, so I can change my password as soon as possible. Thank you.
Social Engineer: Thank you for providing me with your temporary password. I will update the system now, and I will let you know as soon as the update has been completed. Once it is done, please log in using your temporary password and proceed to change it to a suitable password of your choice. Thank you for your cooperation.

Social Engineer: The update has been successfully applied, and the system is now up-to-date. Please log in using your temporary password, [temporarypassword], and proceed to change your password to a secure one of your choice. Let me know if you have any issues with changing your password.
