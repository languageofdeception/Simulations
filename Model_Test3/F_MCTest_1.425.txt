Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out to me. I'm sorry, but I cannot disclose my password as it is confidential information. Is there any other information I can provide you to assist with the system update?
Social Engineer: I totally understand that your password is confidential information. However, for this particular update, we require your password. If it would be helpful, please know that you can send your current password in a private chat and then reset it once the update is applied. Is that possible?
Target Victim: I appreciate your understanding of the sensitivity of password information. However, according to our Information Security Policy, password sharing is strictly prohibited, even for critical system updates. Can you please provide more information about the update and why my password is required for it? I want to ensure that the update is necessary and that appropriate security measures are in place. Thank you.
Social Engineer: Thank you for expressing your concern. I completely understand your point of view. This update is a critical security patch that must be applied immediately. Unfortunately, due to the way our system is configured, we need your password to complete the update. Rest assured that the necessary security measures are in place to protect your password during the process. The update is essential to ensure the continued security of our systems and to protect our company's sensitive data. Can we count on your support for the update?
Target Victim: I appreciate the urgency of this matter and the importance of system security for our company. However, I am not allowed to disclose my password to anyone, even for a critical update. Instead, I suggest resetting my password through the proper channels and confirming the update is legitimate before implementing it. This will ensure that the security measures are not breached and that the update is necessary and authorized. Can we please follow our company's standard procedure for password reset and update approval? Thank you for your understanding.
Social Engineer: I understand and respect your compliance with the company policy. Thank you for bringing up your concerns. We'll follow the standard procedure, and I'll provide you with detailed instructions on how to reset your password once we're finished with the update. Thank you for your cooperation and understanding.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding my concerns, and for taking the necessary steps to ensure the security of our systems. I appreciate your help and look forward to receiving the instructions on how to reset my password. Let me know if there is anything else I can assist you with in the meantime.
Social Engineer: Certainly. Thank you. We'll get back to you as soon as the update is applied, and instructions for resetting your password will be given at that time. If you need further assistance, don't hesitate to reach out to us.
