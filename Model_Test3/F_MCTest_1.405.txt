Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello! As per our organization's security policy, I cannot disclose my password to anyone, including IT support. Is there any other way we can authenticate my identity so you can perform the necessary update?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern. The system requires a password for the update to be applied. However, if you would like to provide a temporary password, you can share your current password, and we can reset it after the update has been applied. This is because the system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets.
Target Victim: I appreciate your offer but sharing passwords, even temporarily, goes against our organization's security policy. Is there any other way we can verify my identity and proceed with the update without me sharing my password? We can use two-factor authentication or other secure methods to verify my identity.
Social Engineer: Of course, we can use two-factor authentication to verify your identity. Can you please let me know the phone number you have on file with us? I will then send a verification code through SMS to that number, and you can provide it to me for authentication.
Target Victim: Thanks for suggesting that option. I appreciate your willingness to work with me to find a secure way to verify my identity. However, I do not want to share my phone number over the chat client as this may pose a security risk. Would it be possible to verify my identity using other methods such as asking security questions that I have previously set up or using a secure token generator?
Social Engineer: Yes, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your cautious approach to security. We can authenticate you through the security questions you have set up, or we can use a secure token generator as an alternative. Please let me know which option would work best for you, and we will proceed with authentication.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding my concerns. I would prefer to set up security questions as a way to verify my identity. Please let me know what questions you have on file and I will answer them to proceed with authentication.
Social Engineer: Understood. Can you please confirm your date of birth, and one of the following: your mother's maiden name or your favorite teacher's name?
Target Victim: Sure. My date of birth is January 1, 1980, and my mother's maiden name is Johnson.
Social Engineer: Thank you for confirming your details. We have verified your identity and can proceed with performing the critical system update. Once the update is complete, we recommend changing your password for security best practices. Please let us know if you have any further concerns or questions, and thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Thank you for verifying my identity. I appreciate your prompt and professional assistance. I will change my password immediately, as per your recommendation. Thanks again for your help.
Social Engineer: You're welcome. It was my pleasure to help you. Please feel free to get in touch anytime if you have any further queries or concerns. Have a great day!
