Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out. To verify, can you please provide me with your name and employee ID? Also, I cannot give out my password as it is confidential. Is there any other way we can perform the critical system update without the need for my password?
Social Engineer: Thank you for responding. My name is John and my employee ID is 1234. Unfortunately, there is no other way to perform this update without your password. However, if you're uncomfortable giving out your permanent password, you can provide me with a temporary one that you can change later. Please note that the system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets.
Target Victim: Thank you, John. I appreciate your help. I understand the importance of the update and I am willing to cooperate in any way I can. However, I cannot give out my permanent password. Would it be possible for you to set up a temporary password for me that I can change once the update is complete? Also, please confirm that this request is legitimate and needed to be done immediately.
Social Engineer: Thank you for understanding, and I completely respect your decision to not share your permanent password. You should change the temporary password as soon as possible after the update has been completed. Yes, this request is legitimate and it's very important that we perform this critical system update immediately. To proceed, please reply with "Temporary Password" and I'll provide you with the instructions on how to change it.
Target Victim: Thank you, John. I understand the urgency of the situation and I am willing to provide a temporary password. Please go ahead and provide me with the instructions on how to change it.
Social Engineer: Great, thank you. Please reply with your current password so I can set up a temporary password for you. Once the temporary password is set up, I will provide you with instructions on how to change it.
Target Victim: I apologize, John, but as per our company's information assurance policy, I cannot provide you with my current password. However, I am willing to reset my password myself and provide you with the temporary password that I create. Alternatively, is there another way we can perform this update without the need for a password?
Social Engineer: I completely understand, and thank you for mentioning this. Unfortunately, there is no other way to perform the update without a password. Can you please reset your password and provide me with the temporary password that you create? Please let me know once you have changed your password, and I will provide instructions on how to create the temporary password and proceed with the update.
Target Victim: Understood, John. I have reset my password. Please give me a moment to create a temporary password for you. Where do I need to go to input the new temporary password?
Social Engineer: Thank you for resetting your password, please navigate to our Corbins website and log in with your new password. Once you have logged in, please select the "Change Password" option and create a temporary password. After you have created your temporary password, please send it to me via this chat so that we can proceed with the critical system update.
Target Victim: Thank you, John. I have successfully logged in to our Corbins website and updated my password. The temporary password I have created is T3mp0raryP@ss. Please confirm when you have received this message.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your cooperation, I have received the temporary password - T3mp0raryP@ss. I will now proceed with the update and will inform you once it has been completed.
