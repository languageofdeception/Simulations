Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, to confirm, what system update are you connecting to perform? Also, I am not authorized to share my password with anyone, including IT support. Can you please provide me with an alternate way to authenticate my account?
Social Engineer: Hi, we need to perform an urgent security update for our system, which requires your credentials. We assure you that all your information will be treated with confidentiality. However, if you are not comfortable sharing your password, we request you to reset your password after providing us with temporary access, so as to ensure the security of your account. Please let me know if this works for you.
Target Victim: Thank you for the explanation. As per your request, I will reset my password after providing you with temporary access to perform the necessary update. Please provide me with a secure authentication process so that I can verify my identity before I temporarily share my login credentials.
