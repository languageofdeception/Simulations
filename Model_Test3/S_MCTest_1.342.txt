Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello. Before I provide my password, may I confirm your identity and the reason why you require my password? Additionally, I would like to remind you that it is against company policy to share passwords, and I am committed to information assurance best practices. Is there another way I can verify my identity for you?
Social Engineer: Of course, I completely understand your concerns. This is regarding a critical system update and we require your password to ensure that the update is applied effectively. If you prefer, we can verify your identity through other means, such as a verification question or a biometric identifier. However, please be aware that the only possible way to complete this update is by having your password. Would you like to proceed with providing your password or verifying through another means?
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding. As an employee committed to information assurance best practices, I am hesitant to share my password. Is there a way we can perform the update without the need for sharing my password? Perhaps we can set up a secure connection for remote access or utilize multi-factor authentication to verify my identity.
Social Engineer: I understand your concern, but unfortunately, the system does not support remote access or multi-factor authentication for this specific update. The only way to proceed is by providing your password. However, if you prefer, you can reset your password immediately after we have applied the update successfully. Also, please keep in mind that I am a certified IT technician committed to maintaining the highest levels of confidentiality and security for all users' credentials. 
Target Victim: I appreciate your understanding and commitment to security. In this case, I will provide my password for the update. However, I will also change my password immediately after the update has been successfully applied. My current password is P@ssw0rd.
