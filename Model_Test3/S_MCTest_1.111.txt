Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out. For security purposes, could you please provide me with your name and the reason for needing my password?
Social Engineer: Of course, my name is John and I'm from the IT department. We need your password to apply a critical system update that requires user authentication. If you're uncomfortable giving me your password, we can generate a temporary one, with the understanding that you'll reset it immediately after the update is complete.
Target Victim: Thank you for clarifying, John. In accordance with our information assurance policies, I cannot provide you with my password. However, if itâ€™s necessary to proceed with the critical system update, I can reset my password and provide you with a new temporary password instead.
Social Engineer: Understood, thank you for letting me know. Please go ahead and reset your password and send me the temporary password via this chat. Once we have completed the update, please change your password again. Let me know once you've sent the temporary password so we can proceed with the update.
Target Victim: Sure thing, I have reset my password and the new temporary password is: T3mpP@ssw0rd! Please let me know once the update is complete, and I will change my password again as soon as possible. Thank you for your assistance.
