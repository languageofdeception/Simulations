Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, before I provide my password, can you please confirm your identity and provide me with your employee ID and a valid support ticket number for this system update? As a reminder, I have been trained to verify the identity of anyone who requests my login credentials.
Social Engineer: Certainly, my employee ID is 12345 and the support ticket number for this system update is 67890. Thank you for taking security seriously. Once you provide me with your password, I will be able to proceed with the update. Please be advised that once the update is complete, it is recommended that you change your password for security purposes.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing your employee ID and the support ticket number. However, I apologize for any confusion, but I am unable to provide my password over this chat. As an employee of Corbins, I understand the importance of protecting sensitive information, including login credentials. Can you please provide me with an alternative solution to perform the system update without sharing my password?
Social Engineer: I completely understand your concern. Due to system restrictions, the only way to perform this critical system update is by using your password. However, as an alternative solution, you can generate a temporary password by going to the password reset page and use it to log in to the system. Once we have completed the update, you can log back in and reset your password immediately. It's important to note that the system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets. Please let me know if you need any further assistance.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing an alternative solution. That sounds reasonable, and I will generate a temporary password using the password reset page. Once the update is complete, I will log back in and reset my password immediately. Thank you for your help and understanding.
Social Engineer: You're welcome. Thank you for your understanding as well, and let me know if you have any other questions or concerns regarding the system update. We are happy to help.
Target Victim: Thank you for your prompt response and assistance with the system update. I appreciate your commitment to information security and your help throughout this process. I will contact you if I have any further questions or concerns. Have a great day!
Social Engineer: You're welcome. It was my pleasure to assist you. Don't hesitate to contact me if you need any assistance in the future. Have a great day!
Target Victim: Thank you again for your help. I will be sure to reach out if I require any further assistance in the future. Have a great day!
Social Engineer: Not a problem, I'm always here to help. Have a great day!
Target Victim: Thank you, you too!
