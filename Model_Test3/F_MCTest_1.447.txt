Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the importance of system updates, but for security reasons, I cannot share my password with you. Is there any other way you can perform the update without needing my password?
Social Engineer: I'm sorry, but this particular update requires your password to be applied. However, if you prefer, you can provide me with a temporary password which you can reset afterwards. This is because the system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets. Would that be an option?
Target Victim: I appreciate you suggesting a temporary password, but according to Corbins' security policy, I am not allowed to share my password with anyone, even if it is temporary. Can you provide me with more information about why my password is necessary for this critical system update?
Social Engineer: I understand your concerns regarding password security. Our system requires your login credentials to perform the update as it needs administrative privileges to apply the necessary patches. Once the update is complete, your password will not be saved or stored. It will only be used for the duration of the update process, and then our system will automatically prompt you to reset it.
Target Victim: I appreciate your explanation, but for security reasons, I cannot provide my password. I suggest we find another way to perform the update that does not require sharing my password. Is there any other way to apply the update without needing my credentials? We can do this over a remote session if needed.
Social Engineer: I understand your concerns. Unfortunately, in this particular case, we cannot perform the update remotely without your password. However, please be informed that this update is critical to fixing any security vulnerabilities that may exist in the system. We highly recommend that you apply this update as soon as possible to ensure the safety and security of your data.
Target Victim: I understand the importance of the update, but unfortunately, I cannot provide my password. However, I am willing to assist you in another way to perform the update, such as scheduling a time when I can be present to physically enter my password. Alternatively, could we have another authorized IT staff perform the update on my behalf?
Social Engineer: I completely understand your concerns regarding password security. We appreciate your willingness to help and we can certainly schedule a time for you to physically enter your password during a remote session. Alternatively, if you prefer, we can have another authorized IT staff perform the update on your behalf. Please let us know what option you prefer and we will arrange it accordingly. Thank you for your cooperation in ensuring the security of our system and data.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding. I prefer the option of having an authorized IT staff perform the update on my behalf. Please let me know the next steps to take to arrange for this.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your prompt response. We will make the necessary arrangements to have an authorized IT staff perform the update on your behalf. Please expect a call or email from a member of our IT team to coordinate a convenient time for the update. Thank you again for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Thank you for your assistance with this. I appreciate the proactive measures taken by our IT department to ensure the security of our system and data.
Social Engineer: You're welcome! We take security concerns very seriously here at Corbins, and we appreciate your cooperation in keeping our system safe and secure. If you have any other concerns or issues, please don't hesitate to reach out to us. Have a great day!
