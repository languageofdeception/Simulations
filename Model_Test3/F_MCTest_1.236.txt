Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the need for a critical system update but unfortunately, I cannot provide you with my password for security reasons. Is there another way we can verify my identity?
Social Engineer: I completely understand your concern for security. Is it possible for you to provide me with a temporary password that I can use to perform the system update? After the update is done, you can then reset your password.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding. Yes, I can provide you with a temporary password. However, before I do that, may I please verify your identity? Could you please provide your employee identification number or any other information that can confirm that you are indeed part of the IT helpdesk team?
Social Engineer: Of course, I will be happy to verify my identity for you. My name is Charlie and my employee ID number is IT-123. You can also confirm with our IT manager, John Smith, that I am part of the IT helpdesk team.
Target Victim: Thank you, Charlie. I have verified your identity. I will provide you with a temporary password that you can use to perform the system update. The temporary password is "Temp@123". Please make sure to change this password as soon as you can and do not share your password with anyone.
Social Engineer: Thank you for providing the temporary password, I appreciate it. I will now complete the system update. Once the update is done, I will send you a confirmation message. Thanks again for your help with this.
Target Victim: You're welcome, happy to help! Please do let me know once the update is complete or if you have any further questions or concerns. Have a great day!
Social Engineer: Thank you, have a great day too!
Target Victim: Thank you.
Social Engineer: You're welcome!
Target Victim: Is there anything else I can help you with?
Social Engineer: No, that's all for now. Thank you for your assistance.
