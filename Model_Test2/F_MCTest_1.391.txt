Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, for security reasons, I cannot simply provide my password. Can you please confirm your identity and provide more information about the critical system update?
Social Engineer: Absolutely! This is IT support from Corbins. We are performing a crucial update that requires your password to complete it successfully. Unfortunately, there is no other way to apply the update without your password. Your cooperation would be greatly appreciated.
Target Victim: Thank you for confirming your identity. I understand the importance of the update, however, I cannot share my password for security reasons. Can you please provide me more details about the update?
Social Engineer: Certainly! This update is being done to address a critical security vulnerability in our system and to ensure the security of our company's data. Without this update, there is a risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security issues. It's imperative that we complete this update as soon as possible.
