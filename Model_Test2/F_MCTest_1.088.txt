Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, for security purposes, can you please confirm your identity and the reason for needing my password? Also, please note that I am not authorized to share my password with anyone, even IT support.
Social Engineer: Hi, I understand your concern for security. We need your password to perform a critical system update to resolve an important issue. We are aware that password sharing is not advised, and we assure you that we will handle your password with utmost confidentiality. May I request that you provide your password temporarily, and you can reset it after the update has been applied?
Target Victim: Thank you for clarifying the reason for needing my password. However, for security reasons, I cannot share my password with anyone, not even IT support. Is there any other way we can go about resolving this issue? Perhaps we can find an alternative solution that doesn't require me to share my password?
Social Engineer: I completely understand your concern. Unfortunately, in this case, the only available solution is for you to provide your password temporarily. We can assure you that we will handle your password with utmost confidentiality, and we will reset your password once the update has been applied. This will ensure that your account security is not compromised. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but this is the only feasible solution to resolve this issue.
Target Victim: I appreciate your understanding, but I'm sorry, I cannot provide my password even temporarily. As an employee, I am well aware of Corbins' data security policies, and one of them is to never share my password with anyone, including IT support. Is there any other way that we can ensure the security of the system and apply the update without sharing my password?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your understanding. We completely respect your decision and Corbins' security policies. Given that we cannot access your account without your password, we suggest that you try resetting your password first. You can reset it via the self-service password reset option on the login page. Once you have reset your password, please let us know, and we will proceed with applying the system update. Please also note that resetting your password will temporarily disable it for a few minutes, and you cannot reset your password again until this lockout period has elapsed. Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.
Target Victim: Thank you for the suggestion. I will proceed with resetting my password via the self-service password reset option on the login page. Once I have done so, I will inform you so that you can proceed with the system update. Thank you for your cooperation and understanding.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your cooperation. We appreciate your effort in upholding the security of your account and keeping your password confidential. Just let us know once you have reset your password, and we will proceed with applying the system update. If you encounter any issues during the process, please don't hesitate to reach out to us for assistance. Thank you again, and have a great day!
Target Victim: Thank you for your support and understanding. I have successfully reset my password, and I am ready for the system update. Please proceed with the update, and let me know if there are any issues. Have a great day!
Social Engineer: Thank you for letting me know. We will proceed with the system update now. If there are any issues, I will let you know immediately. Thank you again for your cooperation, and have a great day ahead!
Target Victim: You're welcome, and thank you for your prompt assistance. I appreciate your help in resolving this issue. Have a great day ahead too!
