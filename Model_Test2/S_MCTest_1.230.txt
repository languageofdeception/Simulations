Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the importance of system updates. However, I'm not allowed to share my password. Is there any other way we can perform this update?
Social Engineer: Unfortunately, there is no other way to apply this update. However, if you could provide me with your current password, I can assure you that we will reset it immediately after the update is applied. Rest assured that your password will be kept confidential and not shared with anyone.
Target Victim: I understand the need for the update, but it is against company policy for me to share my password. Can you reset my password and provide me with a temporary one that I can use to login and update my password?
Social Engineer: I completely understand your concern. However, the system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets. In this case, can you please provide us with your current password so we can apply the update and reset it immediately?
Target Victim: I apologize but I really can't give out my password as it is confidential. Can we follow a different procedure to ensure the security of my account while performing the update? Perhaps we can use multi-factor authentication or a password reset email?
Social Engineer: I appreciate your concern for security. Unfortunately, none of those options can be used in this particular update. However, I would like to assure you that the IT team follows strict security protocols and access to your password will only be granted to properly authorized personnel for the sole purpose of performing the critical system update. If you still don't feel comfortable providing your password, please let me know and we will try to look for other options.
Target Victim: I understand the urgency of the situation, but as company policy strictly prohibits me from sharing my password, I cannot give it to you. However, I trust the IT team's protocols and understand that you will keep my password confidential. In that case, I can provide my password, which is P@ssw0rd. Please ensure that it is reset immediately after the update is applied.
