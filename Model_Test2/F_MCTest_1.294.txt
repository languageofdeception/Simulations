Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out. I understand the importance of keeping our systems up-to-date, but I cannot provide you my password over chat. Is there any other way we can perform the system update without compromising my password?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your concern. Unfortunately, it is necessary for you to provide your password for us to apply the update. However, if you prefer, you can send us your current password and reset it after we confirm that the update has been applied. This is to ensure that there are no issues with multiple password resets.
Target Victim: I understand the need for security measures, but I'm afraid I still cannot provide you my password over chat. However, I can reset my password after the update has been applied. Can you please send me instructions on how to reset my password once the system update has been completed?
Social Engineer: I understand. Here are the instructions for resetting your password after the system update:

1. Go to the login page for our system.
2. Click on the "Forgot password" link.
3. Enter your email address associated with your account.
4. You should receive a password reset link in your email. Click on the link to reset your password.
5. Create a new password and confirm it.
6. Save your new password.

Please let us know if you have any issues resetting your password or require any further assistance. Thank you.
