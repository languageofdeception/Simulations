Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I am a bit hesitant to provide my password over the chat client. Could you please verify your identity and the reason for the update?
Social Engineer: Sure, I completely understand your concern. My name is John and I work in the IT support department at Corbins. We need your password to apply a critical system update that is required to patch some security vulnerabilities. If it makes you more comfortable, you can provide a temporary password and reset it immediately after the update is applied.
Target Victim: Thank you for verifying your identity and the reason for the update. I appreciate your understanding. Here is a temporary password for you to use during the update: CorbinsP@ssw0rd123. I will change it immediately after the update is applied.
