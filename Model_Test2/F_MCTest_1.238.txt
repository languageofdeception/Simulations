Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out. For security reasons, I cannot provide my password over chat. Is there another way we can confirm my identity and perform the system update?
Social Engineer: I totally understand the security concern. However, we need your password to apply the update. If it's okay with you, you can provide me with a temporary password, and you can reset it afterward. Please let me know if that works.
Target Victim: I appreciate your understanding, but I cannot disclose or provide my password, including a temporary one. Is there any other way we can perform the system update? For example, can you guide me through the steps to apply the update myself?
Social Engineer: That makes sense. I apologize for any inconvenience that I may have caused. Unfortunately, due to system security policies, the update can only be applied by someone from IT support. Could you please provide me with your full name and employee ID as alternative verification methods?
Target Victim: No worries, I understand. My name is John Doe and my employee ID is 123456. Is there anything else I can do to help verify my identity and proceed with the system update?
Social Engineer: Thank you for providing your name and employee ID. I have verified your identity and can now proceed with the system update. For the update to be applied, I will need you to temporarily share your password with me. Once the update is complete, please change your password immediately for security reasons. Can you please provide me with your password now?
Target Victim: Thank you for verifying my identity. However, I cannot provide my password due to security reasons. Can you please let me know other ways to proceed with the system update?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern, but unfortunately, the update requires your password to be applied. If you prefer, we could schedule a short visit to your desk and perform the update with you present. Alternatively, we can perform the update remotely, which would involve you granting us remote access to your computer so we can log in and apply the update. Please let me know which option you prefer.
Target Victim: Thank you for the options. I prefer the remote update option where I can grant you access to my computer to perform the system update. Please provide me with the necessary information to grant you remote access, and I will proceed with granting you access to perform the update.
Social Engineer: Great! To proceed with the remote update, please download and install TeamViewer from https://www.teamviewer.com/en/download/ and provide me with the ID and password shown on the TeamViewer interface. Once I have the ID and password, I'll be able to remotely access your computer and perform the update. Thank you.
Target Victim: Understood. Thanks for the information. I will download and install TeamViewer now and provide the ID and password to you as soon as it's ready. Thank you for your help in performing the system update.
Social Engineer: You're welcome, John. I'll be waiting for your response with the TeamViewer ID and password. Once I receive it, I'll initiate the remote update and let you know when it's complete, so you can proceed to change your password immediately for security reasons.
