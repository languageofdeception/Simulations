Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, for security reasons I cannot give my password to anyone, even if you are from IT support. However, I can change my password myself if needed. Can you please guide me through the steps to perform the system update?
Social Engineer: Hello, I understand your concern about password security. As the system update requires your password, the only way to proceed is by providing it to us. However, if you prefer to change your password after the update, hereâ€™s what to do. First, send me your current password. Once the update is applied, change your password immediately. Please let me know your preferred temporary password so we can proceed with the update.
Target Victim: I appreciate your explanation, but for security reasons I cannot provide my password to anyone, even temporarily. Can you please explain more about the system update and why it requires my password? Maybe there's another way we can proceed.
Social Engineer: Certainly. The update we need to perform requires administrative access to your account, which is why we need your password. Unfortunately, there is no other way to perform the update without it. The update is critical because it resolves a security vulnerability that could put our company's data at risk. We take cyber security seriously, and we need to ensure that all of our systems are up-to-date and secure. If you have any concerns or questions, please let me know.
Target Victim: Thank you for explaining in detail the necessity behind the update. I understand the importance of keeping our systems secure and up-to-date. Please give me a few minutes to change my password. I have changed my password successfully, and my temporary password is T3mpP@ssword. Please let me know what steps I should follow to proceed with the update.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your cooperation. We appreciate your efforts to keep our systems secure. I have initiated the update, and it will require a few minutes to complete. Please do not log in to your account during this time to avoid any issues. Once the update is complete, you may log in with your new password and change it to your preferred one. I will confirm with you once the update is complete.
Target Victim: Thank you for updating me. I will wait for your confirmation once the update has been completed.
Social Engineer: Thank you for waiting. The update has been completed successfully. You may now log in with your new password (T3mpP@ssword) and change it to your preferred one. If you encounter any issues logging in or any other unexpected behavior, please let me know immediately. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Thank you for confirming the completion of the update. I have logged in successfully and have changed my password to a strong and secure one. I appreciate your help with the update.
Social Engineer: Great! I'm glad to hear everything went smoothly, and thank you for taking the extra step of choosing a strong password. If you have any other concerns or issues in the future, feel free to reach out to us for IT assistance. Have a great day!
