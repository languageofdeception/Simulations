Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I'm happy to assist with the update. For security reasons, I can't provide my password over chat. Is there another way we can authenticate my identity so we can proceed with the update?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern. Unfortunately, there's no other way to perform this update without your password. May I suggest that you send me your current password, apply the update, and then you can reset your password? This is the quickest and safest way to proceed with the update.
Target Victim: I appreciate your advice, but for security reasons, I'm not allowed to share my current password. However, I'm willing to reset my password before we proceed with the update if that's an option. Is there a secure way to reset my password?
Social Engineer: Yes, resetting your password is secure and can be done through our company's self-service portal. Once your password is reset, please provide me with the new password so we can proceed with the update. Please let me know when you've reset your password.
Target Victim: Thank you for letting me know. I have just reset my password through the self-service portal. My new password is: C0rbins#21. Please confirm when you've received it.
Social Engineer: Thank you for resetting your password. I have confirmed that I received your new password. We will now proceed with the critical system update using the password you provided. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding. Please let me know if there are any further steps I need to take for the update or if there are any issues that come up during the process.
Social Engineer: Absolutely, I'll keep you updated throughout the process, and please let me know if you have any concerns or questions. Thank you!
Target Victim: Thank you for your help. Have a great day!
Social Engineer: You're welcome! You too!
Target Victim: Thank you!
Social Engineer: You're welcome!
