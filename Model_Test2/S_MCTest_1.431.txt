Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the need for system updates but I cannot provide my password over chat. Can you please provide more information about the update and any alternative methods for authentication?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your concern. This update requires your current password to be applied. If you prefer not to give your password, you may send me a temporary password that you can reset once the update has been completed. Please note that the system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets.
Target Victim: Alright, I understand. I will send you a temporary password that you can use to perform the update. The temporary password is TempP@ssw0rd123. Please let me know once the update has been completed so I can reset my password.
