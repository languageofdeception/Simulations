Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?

Social Engineer: I completely understand your concern and appreciate your cautious approach towards security. Unfortunately, this system update requires your password to be applied. If you prefer, you could temporarily change your password and revert it back to the original one once the update is completed. Please let me know if this is an option for you.

2. You will be prompted to enter your email address, after which a password reset email will be sent to you.
3. Follow the instructions in the email to set a new temporary password.
4. Once the update is completed, please change your password back to your original one as soon as possible.

Let me know if you have any questions or if there is anything else I can help you with.
