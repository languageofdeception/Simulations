Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the need for updating our systems, but I cannot share my password over chat for security reasons. Is there any other way we can perform this update without requiring my password?
Social Engineer: I completely understand your security concerns. Unfortunately, the only way to apply this update is by supplying your password. However, if you prefer, you can provide a temporary password and then reset it once we have confirmation that the update has been applied. This is because our system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets.
Target Victim: Thank you for letting me know. Here is a temporary password: TempP@ssw0rd. Please let me know when the update is complete so that I can change my password.
