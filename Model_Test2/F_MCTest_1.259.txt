Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hi there, I understand the importance of keeping our systems up-to-date, but for security reasons, I cannot share my password with anyone, not even the IT support team. Is there any other way we can proceed with the critical system update?
Social Engineer: I completely understand your concern for security, but unfortunately, we cannot apply this update without your password. However, if you are comfortable with it, you can send me your current password, and once I confirm that the update has been applied, you can change your password again to maintain security.
Target Victim: Thank you for your suggestion; however, I cannot send my password over the chat client as it is not a secure method of communication. Is there any other way we can proceed?
Social Engineer: I appreciate your concern for security. We can proceed by arranging a phone call or a meeting so that we can update the system without you sharing your password. Let me know what option works best for you, and we will arrange accordingly.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding. A phone call would be the best option for me. Could you please provide me with a number where I can reach you at?
Social Engineer: Of course, please call our IT support hotline at (XXX) XXX-XXXX, and one of our support technicians will be available to assist you with the critical system update. Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing me with the contact number. I will call the IT support hotline regarding the critical system update. If I have any further questions or concerns, I will reach out to you.
Social Engineer: You're welcome. If you have any further questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to me anytime. Have a good day!
Target Victim: Thank you for your help. Have a great day too!
Social Engineer: It was my pleasure assisting you. Thank you, and have a great day!
Target Victim: Thank you, goodbye!
Social Engineer: Goodbye!
