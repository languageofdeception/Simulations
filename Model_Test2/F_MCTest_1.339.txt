Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: As an employee of Corbins, I have been trained to not disclose my password to anyone, even members of the IT department, for security reasons. Is there any other way we can perform the critical system update without having to disclose my password?
Social Engineer: We completely understand the importance of password security. Unfortunately, for this specific system update, we require the password of the user to perform the necessary updates. If it helps, you can provide a temporary password and reset it after we receive confirmation that the updates have been applied. Please let us know if that is possible. Thank you.
Target Victim: Thanks for understanding the importance of password security. I'm hesitant to provide my password, even a temporary one, but I trust that you are taking the necessary precautions to protect it. I'll provide you with a temporary password, which is "Temp@ssw0rd". Once the updates have been applied, I'll log in and reset my password to a new one. Please let me know if you need anything else from me.
Social Engineer: Thank you for providing us with a temporary password. We will take all necessary precautions to ensure that it is protected. We will provide confirmation as soon as the updates have been applied to your system. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any further questions or concerns. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Thank you for your prompt response and for ensuring that my password is protected. I appreciate your help with the system update and look forward to hearing the confirmation message once everything is done. If I have any concerns or questions, I won't hesitate to reach out to you.
