Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hi, before I share my password, can you confirm if there is really a critical system update that requires me to share my password? I want to ensure we are following proper security protocols.
Social Engineer: Yes, we are performing a critical system update to ensure the security of our systems and your data. Can you provide me with your password, please? If you are concerned about security, please know that your password will be kept confidential and we will reset it once the update is complete.
Target Victim: I appreciate your confirmation. As per security protocols, I cannot share my password, even for a system update. Instead, I can reset my password after the update is complete to ensure the security of the system and my account. Please let me know the instructions on resetting my password.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your understanding. Please follow these steps to reset your password after we complete the update: 

1. Go to the login page of the system in question.
2. Click on "Forgot Password?"
3. Follow the prompts to reset your password.
4. Once you've set your new password, please make sure to keep it secure and not share it with anyone.

Please let me know if you need further assistance.
Target Victim: Thank you for your assistance. I will follow these steps to reset my password after the update is complete. Please let me know if you need any additional information from me to complete the update.

We'll inform you as soon as the update is completed so you can reset your password as per the instructions mentioned earlier. If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.
