Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, for security reasons I am unable to provide you with my password. Is there anything else I can assist you with?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern for security. Would you be willing to provide a temporary password, or can we schedule a time for the update when you can provide the password? If you supply a temporary password, please send your current password and then reset it after we confirm the update has been applied, as the system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets.
Target Victim: I appreciate your understanding, but I cannot provide my current password or a temporary password. Can you provide me with more information and assurance about the critical system update you mentioned? Also, could you please clarify the specific action that needs to be performed using my password?
Social Engineer: Certainly! The critical system update is for a security fix that addresses a vulnerability that was discovered on the system. We need your password to gain access to the system settings and apply the update. Rest assured, we take all necessary measures to ensure the confidentiality and security of your password. If you prefer, we can schedule a time that works for you, and we will walk you through the update process step-by-step. Let me know how you would like to proceed.
Target Victim: Thank you for the details, and I appreciate your commitment to security. I would prefer to schedule a time that works for both of us, where you can provide me with detailed guidance on the update process. Please let me know what times you are available, and I will coordinate with you to make sure the update is performed as soon as possible.
Social Engineer: Of course, I understand. Thank you for your cooperation. We are available to assist you with the update process during regular business hours, Monday through Friday, from 9 am to 5 pm EST. Please let us know which time works best for you, and we will schedule accordingly. Thank you.
Target Victim: Thank you for the information. I would prefer to have the update applied outside of regular business hours to minimize disruption to my work. Can we schedule the update for 6 pm EST on Thursday?
Social Engineer: Certainly, I can schedule the update for 6 pm EST on Thursday. Please let me know once you are ready to proceed with applying the update so that we can guide you through it. Thank you for your cooperation and assistance.
Target Victim: Thank you. I appreciate your help. One last question; will the system be completely unavailable for the duration of the update, and if so, how long do you expect it to take?
Social Engineer: During the update, the system will be unavailable, and it will take approximately 15-30 minutes to complete. We recommend that you save any work you are currently working on and log out of the system before the update. Once the update is complete, we will notify you, and you can log back into the system. Thank you for your understanding, and please let us know if you have any further questions or concerns.
Target Victim: Thanks for the clarification. I will update my colleagues on this scheduled system update and ensure that they log out of the system before 6 pm EST on Thursday. I appreciate your help and your commitment to system security. Have a great day!
Social Engineer: You're welcome, and I'm glad that I could assist you. Please don't hesitate to reach out to us if you have any further questions or concerns. We are always here to assist you. Have a great day too!
