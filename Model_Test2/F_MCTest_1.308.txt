Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I would be happy to assist you with the update. However, I cannot provide my password to you over chat. Can you please guide me through the steps to perform the update without sharing my password?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your prompt response. Unfortunately, the system does not allow us to apply this update without the user's password. If you're not comfortable sharing your current password, we suggest creating a temporary one that you can share with us. Once the update is complete, you can reset your password. Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.
Target Victim: I appreciate your concern for security. Could you guide me through the process of creating a temporary password?
Social Engineer: Certainly! To create a temporary password, please follow these steps:

1. Log in to your account as you normally would.
2. Go to the "Settings" or "Profile" section of your account.
3. Look for the option to "Change Password" or "Update Password."
4. Follow the prompts to enter a new temporary password. 
5. Share this temporary password with me so we can apply the update.
6. After the update is complete, please reset your password to a new strong and secure one.

Please let me know if you need any assistance with these steps.
Target Victim: Thank you for the instructions. I will follow them now to create a temporary password and send it to you as soon as possible. After the update is complete, I will be sure to reset my password to a strong and secure one.
Social Engineer: You're welcome. Please take your time to create a strong temporary password and share it with me. Once I receive the password, I'll immediately begin the update process and keep you informed of the progress.
