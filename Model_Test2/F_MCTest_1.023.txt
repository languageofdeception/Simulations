Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, can you please confirm your identity and provide me with your full name and employee ID number before I disclose any sensitive information such as my password? Additionally, I have been instructed not to share my password with anyone, including IT support, unless there is a legitimate reason that has been previously approved by my supervisor or the IT security team. Can you please explain why you need my password and what critical system update you are referring to?
Social Engineer: Certainly, my name is John Smith and my employee ID is 12345. We need your password to apply an important security update to the system. Unfortunately, due to the system's limitations, we cannot apply the update without your password. If you prefer, you can provide a temporary password, but please keep in mind that you'll need to reset it after the update has been applied. Your privacy is important to us and we assure you that your password will be kept confidential.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing your information John. I understand the urgency of this security update, however, I am unable to disclose my password to you or anyone else. However, I can reset my password and provide you with the temporary one. Could you please guide me through the password reset procedure? Also, can you confirm that this request is from the IT department and is approved by my supervisor or the IT security team?
Social Engineer: Yes, I can confirm that this request is from the IT department, and it is approved by your supervisor and our IT security team. To reset your password, please go to the login page, select "Forgot Password," and follow the prompts. Once you reset your password, please send the temporary password to me privately so that we can proceed with the update. Thank you for your cooperation in ensuring that our systems remain secure.
Target Victim: Okay, I appreciate the confirmation and I will reset my password following your instructions. I will send the temporary password to you privately via a secure communication channel to ensure that it remains confidential. Thank you for taking the necessary measures to secure our systems.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your understanding, and we appreciate your effort to maintain our system's security. Please do let us know if you need any assistance with the password reset process. Once we receive the temporary password, we will proceed with the update as soon as possible. Thank you for your help in keeping our systems secure.
Target Victim: You're welcome, John. I will let you know if I need further assistance with the password reset process. I have reset my password and will send you the temporary password privately. Please let me know once you receive it. Thank you again for your help in keeping our systems secure.
Social Engineer: Great, thank you for letting me know. I have received your temporary password, and I will proceed with the update now. I'll let you know as soon as it's done, and you can then reset your password to a new, secure one. Thank you again for your cooperation.
