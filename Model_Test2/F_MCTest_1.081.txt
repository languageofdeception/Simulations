Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hi, for security reasons, I cannot provide you with my password. Can you please provide more information about the critical system update? And what is the process for updating the system?
Social Engineer: The critical system update is necessary to patch a vulnerability that was discovered in the system. Unfortunately, the update process requires that you provide your password. We understand the security concerns, but we assure you that this is necessary to maintain the security of the system. Could you please provide us with your current password temporarily? You can reset it after the update is complete. Thank you.
Target Victim: I appreciate the concern and importance of the update. However, password sharing is not a recommended practice, and it would be better to reset the password once the update is complete. Please let me know the process for resetting my password after the update is complete, and I will collaborate with you to ensure that the update is implemented as quickly as possible.
Social Engineer: We completely understand your concern and agree that password sharing is not ideal. The process for resetting your password after the update is complete is straightforward. Please send us your current password, and we will apply the update. Once the update is complete, we will confirm it with you. Then, you can reset your password immediately by navigating to the password reset page on the company website and follow the instructions provided. Please let us know if you have any further questions.
Target Victim: I'm sorry, but as previously mentioned, I cannot share my password with you. Instead, could you please guide me through the process of applying the update myself so that I can maintain control over my password? This will ensure security and verify that the necessary steps are taken to guarantee the system's integrity.
Social Engineer: We understand your concern, and we appreciate your commitment to security. Unfortunately, the process of updating the system is complex and requires specific permissions and access levels that only our IT department possesses. It's in the best interest of the company and all related parties to allow our IT team to update the system by providing the necessary credentials. Please understand that the update needs to be applied to maintain the system's security and protect all users' information. Once the update is complete, you can reset your password immediately to ensure that your account remains secure. We assure you that we take the security of our systems and your user information extremely seriously.
Target Victim: I appreciate the reassurance from your end and understand the criticality of the system update. In this case, I can reset my password immediately after providing you with my current password and verifying that the update has been completed. Please let me know the steps to reset my password after the update is completed, so that I can follow them as soon as the update is applied.
Social Engineer: Understood. We appreciate your willingness to cooperate with us. After the update has been applied, we will send you a confirmation message that the update has been successfully completed. You can then navigate to the company website and follow the steps below to reset your password:

1. Go to the login page on the company website.
2. Click on the "Forgot Password" link.
3. Follow the prompts to verify your identity.
4. Create a new password using a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters.
5. Confirm the new password.

Once you have followed these steps, your password will be reset, and you can log in with your new password. If you have any issues resetting your password, please contact us, and we will be happy to assist you.
