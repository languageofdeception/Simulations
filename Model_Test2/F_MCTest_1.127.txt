Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the need for security measures but I cannot give out my password to anyone, including IT support. Is there any other identification method we can use to verify my identity?
Social Engineer: I completely understand. Unfortunately, the only way to apply this particular update is by using your password. However, you can send me your current password and then reset it after we confirm that the update has been applied. Is that acceptable?
Target Victim: I appreciate your explanation, however, I still cannot divulge my password. Can you please provide me with more information on the critical system update you need to perform? Additionally, can you please confirm your identity by providing your IT support ticket number or an internal company email? Thank you.
Social Engineer: Of course, I understand your concern. The system update in question is important because it will fix a security vulnerability that could potentially harm our system. As for my identity, my IT support ticket number is [insert ticket number here] and I can send you an internal company email as well. Do let me know how I can assist you further.
Target Victim: Thank you for the additional information and explanation. I appreciate that this is critical for the security of our system. In order to ensure that this request is legitimate, can you please provide your full name and department? Additionally, I will verify the support ticket number with our IT department before proceeding.
Social Engineer: Certainly. My full name is John Smith and I am a part of the IT Operations department. I totally understand the need for verification and I welcome any further steps you need to take to satisfy yourself that this request is legitimate.
Target Victim: Thank you, John. I appreciate your cooperation. At this time, I will need to escalate this conversation to my supervisor to ensure that we are following all of our security protocols correctly. We may need to ask you some additional questions or provide further information to verify your identity and the authenticity of this request. In the meantime, please do not share your password with anyone, even IT support, as this is one of our critical company security policies.
Social Engineer: Certainly, I completely understand and appreciate your concern. Please feel free to escalate this as needed and I will be available to provide any additional information or assistance to help verify my identity and the authenticity of the request. Thank you for taking the time to ensure that our company security protocols are being followed properly.
Target Victim: Thank you for your cooperation and understanding. We'll take all the necessary precautions to ensure the security of our system and network. I will keep you informed on the progress of the request and will reach out to you as soon as we have any updates.
Social Engineer: Understood, thank you for letting me know. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns. I'll be available to assist you as needed.
