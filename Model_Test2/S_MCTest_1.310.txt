Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the need for security, however, I cannot provide you with my password in plain text over a chat client. Can you please verify your identity so that I can be assured that I am providing my password to the right person?
Social Engineer: Of course. Can you please provide your password within the next hour as we have an immediate system update that needs to be completed? We understand your concerns, but we assure you that your password will be kept secure. If you prefer, you can change your password after the update is complete.
Target Victim: I appreciate your urgency to complete the system update, however, I still cannot provide my password in plain text. Can you please verify your identity by providing your name and employee ID? I can then change my password after the update, if needed.
