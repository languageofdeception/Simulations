Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out. For security reasons, I cannot provide you with my password. Can you please provide me with some more information about the update and its purpose?
Social Engineer: Of course, the update is necessary to fix an issue that's affecting the system. We need your password to apply the update as it requires administrative privileges. If necessary, we can set a temporary password for you to use after the update has been applied.
Target Victim: For security reasons, I am not comfortable giving out my password, even for critical system updates. However, I understand the importance of this update and I want to ensure the issue is fixed. Can you please guide me on how to apply the update myself without sharing my password?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern. Unfortunately, the process requires administrative access, so it can only be done by someone with the appropriate permissions. However, if you would like, you can change your password before and after the update. You will need to provide us with the new password so we can apply the update, and then you can change it again once the update is completed. Would that work for you?
Target Victim: I appreciate your suggestion, but as per company policy, I cannot give out my password even if it is temporary. Is there another way to apply the update that doesn't involve giving out my password?
Social Engineer: I understand. Unfortunately, providing your password is the only way to apply this particular update. However, we can guarantee that our IT team follows strict security protocols to ensure the confidentiality of your password. Additionally, we recommend resetting your password as soon as possible after the update has been applied. If you are still uncomfortable sharing your password, we can discuss other solutions or schedule the update for another time when you are available to provide access to the system.
Target Victim: I appreciate your understanding. In this case, I will reset my password before the update and provide you with the temporary password for the duration of the update. After that, I will change my password again to a new password that only I know. Please let me know the temporary password so that I can prepare to use it.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your cooperation. The temporary password is: "Temp@password123". Please let me know when you're ready to proceed with the update, and I will guide you through the process.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing the temporary password. I'll let you know when I'm ready to proceed with the update.
Social Engineer: Great, thank you. Just a quick reminder to change your password as soon as the update has been completed for security reasons. Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.
Target Victim: Thank you for the reminder. I will make sure to change my password as soon as the update is completed. Thank you for your assistance, I don't have any other concerns or questions at this time.
Social Engineer: You're welcome! It was a pleasure assisting you, and if you need any further assistance, feel free to reach out to us anytime. Have a great day!
