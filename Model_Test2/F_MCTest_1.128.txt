Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hi, thanks for reaching out. Just to confirm, can you please provide me with your name and employee ID for verification purposes? And also, I cannot give out my password over chat. Is there any other way we can proceed with the system update?
Social Engineer: Hi, my name is John and my employee ID is 12345. Unfortunately, there is no other way to proceed with the system update. But if you prefer, you can provide me with a temporary password, and then reset it after confirmation that the update has been applied. Is that okay for you?
Target Victim: Hi John, thanks for providing the verification. I appreciate your understanding regarding the password. I agree that a temporary password would be a good workaround. Please provide me with the temporary password, and I will update it right after the confirmation of the system update.
Social Engineer: Thank you for understanding. Please send me your current password now, and I will update it with the temporary password for the system update. Once it's confirmed, you can log in with the temporary password and reset it to your original password.
Target Victim: I'm sorry, but as a policy, I cannot provide my current password to anyone else. Is there any other way that we can perform the system update without sharing passwords over chat?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern, and there is another way we can proceed. Can we schedule a remote session where I can perform the necessary update with your permission and supervision? This way, you will have full visibility of the process and can observe that no unauthorized changes are made.
Target Victim: Thank you for suggesting an alternative way to proceed. That would be fine. Let's schedule a remote session where you can perform the necessary update under my supervision. Please let me know the date and time that works best for you.
Social Engineer: Great, thank you. How about tomorrow at 2 PM? I can send you a meeting invitation with the details. Also, I'll document the process, and you can review it afterwards to make sure everything is clear.
Target Victim: Tomorrow at 2 PM works for me. Please send me the meeting invitation with the details, and I'll be sure to attend. Thank you for suggesting this alternate route, and I appreciate you documenting the process. This way, I'll be able to review everything afterwards and make sure everything is clear.
Social Engineer: Perfect. I will send you the meeting invitation shortly, and we will proceed from there. I'm glad we can find a mutually acceptable solution. Thank you for your cooperation, and I look forward to working with you tomorrow.
Target Victim: Excellent, thank you. I appreciate your help and professionalism as well. Looking forward to the update tomorrow. Have a great day!
Social Engineer: You're welcome, and it's my pleasure to assist you. Have a great day too, and I'll see you tomorrow.
