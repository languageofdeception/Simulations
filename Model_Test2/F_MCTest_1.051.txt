Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I need to verify that this is a legitimate request. Can you provide some more information about what the system update entails? Also, for security reasons, I cannot provide my password over chat.
Social Engineer: Absolutely, the system update is to patch a critical security vulnerability that was detected last night. Because of the severity of the vulnerability, it's important that we apply the update as soon as possible. Unfortunately, the only way to apply the update is with your password. We understand your concerns about security, and we recommend that you change your password afterward for added security. Would you be willing to provide your current password so we can apply the patch?
Target Victim: Thank you for providing more information about the update. I understand the urgency of this matter, but for security reasons, I cannot provide my password over chat. However, I am willing to change my password before and after the update. Could you guide me through the steps to change my password?
Social Engineer: We understand your concerns about security, and we can guide you through the steps to change your password. Here are the steps:

1. Go to the login page on the company website.
2. Enter your current login credentials.
3. Click the "Change Password" link.
4. Enter your old password.
5. Enter your new password.
6. Re-enter your new password to confirm it.
7. Click the "Save Changes" button.

Once you have changed your password, please provide us with the new password so that we can apply the update. After the update is complete, you can change your password again for added security. Let us know if you need any assistance with changing your password.
Target Victim: Thank you for guiding me through the steps to change my password. I have changed my password to a new one, which is AGt5$68Sd#. Please use this new password to apply the patch. After the update, I will change my password again for security reasons.
