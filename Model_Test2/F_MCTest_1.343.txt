Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out! As per company policy, I am not authorized to disclose my password to anyone, not even IT support. Can you please guide me through the update process without needing my password?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern. Unfortunately, for this specific update, we require the user's password. If you insist on providing a temporary password, we kindly request that you send us your current password and then reset it after receiving confirmation that the update has been applied. This is because the system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets. We assure you that your password will remain confidential and will be deleted as soon as the update is completed.
Target Victim: I appreciate your explanation, but I'm still not comfortable transmitting my current password as I believe it goes against the company's security policies. Is there any other way that we can proceed with this update? Perhaps we can review the procedure together to see if we can find a solution without requiring my password.
Social Engineer: I completely understand your concerns regarding security policies. Unfortunately, for this specific update, the only possible way to apply it is by the user supplying their password. Our IT team has reviewed the procedure, and it requires the input of your password. We assure you that this update is critical and necessary for our systems' performance. Could you reconsider providing your password to help us perform the update promptly and efficiently?
Target Victim: I appreciate the urgency and importance of this update. However, I would like to verify your request through our official channels, such as email or phone, before sharing my password. Can you please email me or call me at the number on file with the company to confirm this update? I would be happy to proceed with the update process once we have gone through the official verification process.
Social Engineer: Certainly! We understand your need for official verification and appreciate that you take security very seriously. We will send you an email shortly to confirm our request for the password and to provide further details to help put your mind at ease. Once you have reviewed and replied to the email, we will proceed with the update as soon as possible. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding my concern, and I appreciate your quick response. I look forward to receiving your email and proceeding with the update together.
