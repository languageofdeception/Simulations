Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the importance of system updates, but I cannot provide my password for security reasons. Is there another way for us to perform the update?
Social Engineer: Hello, I understand your concerns about security. However, the only way for us to apply this update is by using the correct password. It's okay to share your current password with us temporarily, and once the update is done, you can change your password to something new. This is because the system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets.
Target Victim: Thank you for explaining the situation to me. I'm sorry for any inconvenience, but I cannot share my current password with you. However, I can change my password to a temporary one and share it with you. Once the update is complete, I will change my password again to a new one. Please let me know if that works for you.
Social Engineer: Yes, that will work. Please change your password to a temporary one and share it with me, and I'll apply the update. Once the update is complete, please change your password to a new one to ensure the security of your account. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding. I have changed my password to: TempP@ssw0rd789. Please let me know once the update is complete, so I can change my password to a new one. Thank you for your assistance.
