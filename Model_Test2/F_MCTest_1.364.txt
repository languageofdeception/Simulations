Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out. Before I provide my password, can you please confirm your identity and provide me with your name and designation?
Social Engineer: Of course. My name is Jane and I am a helpdesk support technician at Corbins. We need your password to apply a critical system update that can only be done with your authorization. We understand the concern about security and assure you that we follow strict protocols to protect your information.
Target Victim: Thank you for the clarification, Jane. For security reasons, I cannot provide my password electronically. Can you please guide me through the process and let me know the steps I need to take to perform the system update? This will allow me to authorize the update without sharing my password.
Social Engineer: We completely understand your concern, and we appreciate your commitment to security. Unfortunately, we cannot perform the update without your password due to the system restrictions. However, if you're willing to provide your password, we can assure you that we will keep it confidential and reset it after the update is complete.
Target Victim: I appreciate the assurance, but I cannot disclose my password. Can you please provide me with an alternative option, such as resetting my password, or perform the system update using another method that does not require me to disclose my password?
Social Engineer: Unfortunately, resetting your password will not work in this case, as the system only allows one password reset at a time. The only way to perform the critical system update is to use your current password. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but we assure you that we take the security of your information very seriously.
Target Victim: I understand the requirements for the system update and appreciate how seriously you take the security protocols. However, I am still hesitant to disclose my password. Is there any way I can contact the IT department directly to verify your request and confirm the need for my password?
Social Engineer: Certainly, I understand that you want to be thorough regarding security. You can verify our request by contacting the IT department directly at our helpdesk email or phone number that is listed on the company website. They will be able to confirm that we require your password for the system update.  Let us know if you need further assistance.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding my concern. I will reach out to the IT department directly using the contact information provided on the company website to verify the request. Once I receive confirmation, I will provide you with my password to proceed with the critical system update. Thank you for your assistance.
Social Engineer: You're welcome. We appreciate your commitment to security and we're glad to know that you will be able to verify our request with the IT department. Please reach out to us once you have confirmation, and we'll proceed with the system update as soon as possible. Thank you for choosing Corbins IT for your support needs.
Target Victim: Thank you for your support, Jane. I truly appreciate your help and understanding. I'll contact the IT department and as soon as I have verified your request, I'll get in touch with you to proceed with the system update. Have a great day!
