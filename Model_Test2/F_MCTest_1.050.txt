Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the need for the system update, but I cannot provide my password over chat for security reasons. Is there any other way to perform the update without sharing my password?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern regarding the security of your password. However, the update can only be applied by logging in with your credentials. If you prefer, you can provide a temporary password for us to use. Once the update has been completed, you can reset your password.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding my concern. I would like to provide a temporary password for you to use. The temporary password is TempPass123. Please make sure to update the password once the update is complete, and let me know when I can log back in with my new password.
Social Engineer: Thank you for providing us with the temporary password. We are able to start the update process. I will inform you when it is complete and you can log in using your new password. Thank you for your cooperation!
Target Victim: You're welcome, and thank you for your assistance in updating the system. Please keep me updated on the progress of the update, and let me know when I can log back in with my new password.
Social Engineer: The update has been completed, and the system is now up to date. You can now log in with your new password that you have set. If you have any other concerns, please let us know. Thank you for your cooperation!
Target Victim: Thank you for letting me know that the update has been completed. I will now reset my password to a more secure one and log in with it. If I have any other concerns, I will reach out to you. Thank you for your help!
Social Engineer: You're welcome! If you need any assistance in the future, feel free to contact us. Have a great day ahead!
Target Victim: Thank you, you too have a great day ahead!
Social Engineer: Thank you, take care and stay safe!
Target Victim: You're welcome, you too take care and stay safe!
