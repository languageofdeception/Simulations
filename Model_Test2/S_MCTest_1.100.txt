Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the need for system updates, however, it is against company policy to share passwords with anyone, including IT support. Is there a different way we can proceed with this critical update?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern. Unfortunately, there is no other way for us to apply this update without your password. Would it be possible for you to provide a temporary password, which you can reset once the update has been applied? Please note that the system only allows for one password reset at a time.

Target Victim: Thank you for suggesting that option. I appreciate your help with the system update, and I can provide you with a temporary password for this purpose.

Please use this temporary password: TempP@ssw0rd123

Once the update has been applied, I will reset the password to my original password, P@ssw0rd. Thank you for your assistance.
