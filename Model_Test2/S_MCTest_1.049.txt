Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, can you please provide me your name and employee ID for verification purposes? Also, can you explain why my password is needed for a system update?
Social Engineer: Of course, my name is John and my employee ID is 12345. We need your password to apply a critical system update that can only be done with user authentication. We assure you that your password will not be shared or stored and you can reset it after the update.
Target Victim: Thank you for the verification. I understand the need for a critical system update, however, I cannot provide my password as it goes against company policy to share or disclose passwords, even for IT support. Is there an alternative way to perform the update without requiring my password?
Social Engineer: We understand your concern regarding password sharing and appreciate your adherence to company policy. Unfortunately, in this case, the system only allows password-protected access to the update. However, we can work with the temporary password option, where you can share your current password, enable us to apply the update, and then reset it immediately after confirmation. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding my concern and providing alternative options. I am willing to use the temporary password option. My current password is P@ssw0rd. Please let me know once the update is complete, so I can reset my password immediately.
