Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hi there! To confirm, are you a legitimate IT support employee employed by Corbins? And could you tell me more about the system update you're referring to? Before providing my password, I need to ensure that this is a legitimate request and that my account's security is not put at risk.
Social Engineer: Yes, I'm a legitimate IT support employee at Corbins. We're performing an urgent security update on our system to prevent a potential security breach. We require your password to apply the update. Your account's security is our top priority, and we assure you that the update is necessary and legitimate. If you're still uncomfortable providing your password, we understand, but please remember that we won't be able to proceed with the update without it. If you want, you can send us a temporary password that you can reset after the update is applied.
Target Victim: Thank you for the clarification. I appreciate your concern for our system's security. In this case, I will provide my password, which is P@ssw0rd, to proceed with the update. However, I do have a few questions. How long will the update take, and will I be notified when it is complete? Also, will there be any downtime or changes to my account's settings as a result of this update?

Furthermore, may I request some details about the specific security threat that this update aims to protect us against?
