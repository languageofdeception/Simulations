Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the importance of system updates. To verify my identity, may I confirm some details before sharing my password?
Social Engineer: Absolutely, please go ahead and confirm your details so we can proceed with the update process.
Target Victim: Thank you. My full name is [Your Full Name] and my employee ID is [Your Employee ID].
Social Engineer: Great, thanks for verifying your details. Please provide me with your password, and I'll apply the necessary updates. 

If it's okay with you, we recommend that you share your current password and reset it later. This is because the system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets.
Target Victim: Thank you for the recommendation, and for helping keep our systems secure. My password is: P@ssw0rd. Please let me know once the updates have been applied.
