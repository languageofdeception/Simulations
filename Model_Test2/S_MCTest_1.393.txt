Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: As an employee of Corbins, I understand the importance of maintaining the security of our systems. However, I cannot provide you with my password as it is against company policy to share passwords with anyone, including members of the IT helpdesk. Is there a different way we can verify my identity or authenticate the update?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your concern with security. Unfortunately for this particular update, the only available option is for you to provide us with your password. However, if it makes you feel more comfortable, you can change your password immediately after the update is applied. Please note that the system only allows one password reset at a time.
Target Victim: I appreciate the clarification. In that case, my password is P@ssw0rd. However, I will definitely change it immediately after the update is applied. Thank you for your assistance.
