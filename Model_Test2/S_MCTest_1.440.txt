Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the importance of system updates, but disclosing my password to anyone is against company policy. Is there any alternative way for us to proceed with the update?
Social Engineer: I completely understand. However, there is no other way for us to apply the update without your password. If it helps, you can provide us with a temporary password which you can reset after the update has been applied. Please keep in mind that the system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets.
Target Victim: Thank you for the information. In that case, here is a temporary password: T3mpP@ssw0rd. Please let me know once the update has been completed so I can reset my password as soon as possible.
