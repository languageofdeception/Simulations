Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the importance of system updates, but for security reasons, I cannot share my password over a chat client. Is there any other information I can provide to assist you with the update?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern about security. However, for this specific update, we do require your password as the system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets. If it helps, you can share a temporary password with us and then reset it after we have completed the update. Please let me know if that would work for you.
Target Victim: I appreciate your understanding. As a temporary measure, I can provide you with a one-time password that I will immediately change after the update is complete. The one-time password is [P@ssw0rd123]. Please secure this temporary password and let me know when the update is completed so that I can set up a new password.
