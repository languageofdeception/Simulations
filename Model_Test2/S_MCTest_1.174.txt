Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I can confirm that I'm an employee at Corbins. However, I cannot provide you with my password as it's against company policy to share personal login credentials. Is there any other way that we can perform the critical system update?
Social Engineer: We understand your concern, but unfortunately, this critical system update requires the user's password. However, we can provide you with instructions on how to set a temporary password, and after we apply the update, we can reset your password. Does that work for you?
Target Victim: I appreciate your explanation, but I'm still hesitant to share my password. However, I can reset my password following your instructions. Can you please provide me with the steps to do so?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your understanding. Here are the steps to reset your password:

1. Go to the login page and click on the "Forgot Password" link.
2. On the next page, enter your email address associated with your account and click the "Submit" button.
3. You will receive an email with a link to reset your password.
4. Click on the link and follow the instructions to set a new password.
5. After you have reset your password, please send us the temporary password, and we will apply the critical system update.
6. You should then reset your password to a new one for security purposes.

Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
Target Victim: Thank you for the instructions. I will reset my password following these steps, and I will send you the temporary password once it's set. Thank you for your help.
Social Engineer: No problem at all, happy to help! Just let me know once the temporary password is set, and we'll proceed with the critical system update.
Target Victim: I have now reset my password, and the temporary password is "TempP@ssw0rd". Please let me know once the critical system update has been completed so that I can change my password to a new, secure one.
