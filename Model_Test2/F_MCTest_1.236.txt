Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out. I'm sorry but I cannot provide my password due to the security policies of our company. Is there any other way I can assist in performing the critical system update?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern. However, in this case, we need your password to ensure the update is applied correctly. We can assure you that your password will be treated with the utmost privacy and security. If you still cannot provide your password, we suggest sending us a temporary password. Please send us your current password first and then reset it after we have confirmed that the update is successful. Thank you.
