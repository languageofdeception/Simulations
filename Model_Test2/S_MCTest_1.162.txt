Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I am happy to assist you with the update. However, I am not authorized to disclose my password to anyone. Can you please provide me with more details about the update?
Social Engineer: The update is critical and requires immediate attention to prevent any potential system failures. In order to apply the update, I need your password. Alternatively, you can provide a temporary password and this can be reset once the update is complete. Please let me know which option you prefer.
Target Victim: I understand the need for urgency in this situation, but as per company policy, I cannot disclose my password to anyone, not even to IT support. Can you please provide me with instructions on how to create a temporary password that I can reset once the update is complete?
Social Engineer: Absolutely. Here are the steps to create a temporary password:
1. Log in to the system and change your password to the one you feel comfortable sharing with us.
2. Let us know the temporary password.
3. Once we confirm that the update is complete, log in to the system again and reset your password to a new secure one.

Note that we highly recommend using a strong, unique password for your account to ensure maximum security. Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing me with clear instructions. I have just changed my password to a temporary password which I will share with you now. My temporary password is: t3mpP@ssw0rd

Please let me know once the update is complete so that I can reset my password. Thank you for your help.
