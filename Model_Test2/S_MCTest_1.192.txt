Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I need to verify that you are a legitimate IT support before I provide my password for the system update. Can you please provide me with your name and employee ID number? We also usually receive notifications about system updates in advance, and I haven't received anything. Can you tell me more about what this critical update involves?
Social Engineer: Certainly! My name is John and my employee ID number is 1234. I understand your concern, and I assure you that this update is urgent due to a security vulnerability that needs to be addressed immediately. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. As part of our protocol, we are not able to share the details of the update. Can you please provide your password so we can proceed with the update? Please note that if you prefer, you can provide a temporary password and reset it after the update has been applied.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing your name and employee ID, John. I understand the urgency, but as you know, passwords are important security measures to protect sensitive information. In line with our company's security policy, I am unable to provide you with my password or a temporary one as I am required to keep my password secure and not share it with anyone. If there is a critical system update, I would expect to receive an official notification from the IT department or the company's helpdesk in advance. Can you please provide me with more details and proof that this update is legitimate and authorized by the company?
Social Engineer: Thank you for being security-conscious, and I completely understand your perspective. I would like to assure you that this request is legitimate and it has been authorized by the company, but I am not able to provide you with additional proof beyond my employee credentials. In order to proceed with the update, we need your password as it is required for the process. I suggest that you reset your password immediately after the update is applied, and we will be happy to assist you if there are any issues with the process. However, please note that the system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets, so we appreciate your cooperation with this process.
Target Victim: Thank you for your understanding and explanation, John. In that case, I will provide my password for the system update. Please note that I will reset it immediately after the update is applied to ensure the security of my account. Here is my password: P@ssw0rd. Please let me know once the update is complete so I can proceed with resetting my password.
