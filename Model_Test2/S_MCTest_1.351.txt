Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the importance of system updates, but I cannot provide you with my password over chat. Can you please provide me with more information about the update and how it will affect my work? Also, is there another way for me to verify my identity without divulging my password?
Social Engineer: Sure, I completely understand your concern regarding your password. The update is critical as it addresses some security concerns and system bugs that have been reported. It will only take a few minutes, and you will not lose any data. Unfortunately, there is no other way to verify your identity without your password, but we can take additional measures to ensure it's safe. If you're uncomfortable giving your password, you can create a temporary one, complete the update, and reset your password afterward. Please let me know which option you would like to go with.
Target Victim: Thank you for the explanation. I appreciate the concern for security and the idea of creating a temporary password. I will go ahead and create a temporary password for you to use during the update. The temporary password is: TempP@ssw0rd123. Please let me know once you have completed the update so that I can change my password back to my original one.
