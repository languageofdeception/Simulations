Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the need for security but please note that I cannot provide my password over chat. Is there an alternate way to perform the critical system update?
Social Engineer: Hi, I understand your concern, but unfortunately, we need your password to perform this critical system update. However, you can provide us with a temporary password, use it for the update, and reset it afterwards. Please share your current password so we can proceed.
Target Victim: I'm sorry, but I cannot provide my password as it is against company policy to share passwords or use the same password for a long time. Can you guide me through the authentication process or let me know if there are any other security measures available for verifying my identity?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your understanding. For security reasons, we do not have any other authentication options other than using your password to perform the update. However, we can schedule an on-site visit or arrange a phone call to verify your identity and perform the update. Please let me know your convenient time, and we will arrange it accordingly.
Target Victim: Thank you for your offer. I will be available for an on-site visit tomorrow at 10 AM. Please let me know the details of the verification process and what I need to bring with me for the visit.
Social Engineer: Thank you for providing the details. During the on-site visit, we will verify your identity by checking your government-issued ID and asking some security questions.

Please bring your company ID and government-issued ID (e.g., driver's license, passport) with you to the visit.

Once we have verified your identity, we will perform the critical system update. Thank you for your cooperation in ensuring the security of our systems.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing the details. I will be sure to bring my company ID and government-issued ID with me during the on-site visit. It's always important to prioritize the security of our system, and I'm glad that you've taken the necessary steps to ensure that.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your cooperation, and we appreciate your understanding. We take the security of our systems very seriously, and we always strive to ensure that your information remains secure. If you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out anytime.
Target Victim: Thank you for your prompt response. I appreciate your efforts in maintaining the security of our systems. If I have any further questions or concerns, I will get in touch with you or the IT helpdesk.
Social Engineer: You're welcome, and it's our pleasure to assist you. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any further questions or concerns. We're always happy to help. Have a great day!
