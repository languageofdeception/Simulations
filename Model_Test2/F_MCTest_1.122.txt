Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I am happy to help with the critical system update. However, I will not be able to provide you with my password as it is against company policy to share passwords. Is there any other way I can assist you with the update?
Social Engineer: I understand your concern and thank you for bringing this to our attention. Rest assured, we will ensure the highest level of security measures while working with your password. The system update requires direct access to your account, and unfortunately, there is no alternate way to apply this update. If you prefer, you can provide us with a temporary password and then reset your password after we confirm that the update has been applied. Please let us know how you would like to proceed.
Target Victim: I appreciate the precautions you are taking, but I still cannot provide my password. Is it possible to perform the system update without direct access to my account? Perhaps by logging in as an admin or performing the update remotely? Let me know if that is a possibility. If not, perhaps we can schedule a time when I can be present and provide my password directly to you.
Social Engineer: I understand your concerns, and unfortunately, updating your account requires direct access as it is a security measure to prevent unauthorized access. However, we appreciate your suggestion and will explore all possible options. Scheduling a time to perform the update whilst you are present is a good idea. Please let us know when you are available, and we will make sure to arrange the update accordingly. Thank you for your assistance in ensuring the security of our system.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding my concerns. I am available next Tuesday at 2 PM to perform the update. Please let me know if this time works or if there is another time and day that is more suitable for the update.
Social Engineer: Thank you for providing your availability. Unfortunately, Tuesday afternoon is not a convenient time for our team to perform the update as our technicians are already scheduled with other critical projects. Is there any other day that works best for you? If not, please let me know if Wednesday at 4 PM works for you, and we will schedule the update accordingly to ensure that your account is updated.
Target Victim: Thank you for letting me know. I understand that you have other critical projects to manage. Wednesday at 4 PM would be a great time for the system update. Please confirm that the update won't take longer than 30 minutes and also let me know what I need to do to prepare for the update before the scheduled time.
Social Engineer: Great! I will notify the technicians to schedule the update for Wednesday at 4 PM. The update should only take approximately 15 minutes, but we suggest allowing for 30 minutes, just in case. Before we start the update, we recommend that you save any unsaved work and log out of the system if you are currently logged in. After the update, you can log back in and verify that everything is working correctly. We will notify you when the update is complete, and you can then reset your password for added security.
Target Victim: Excellent, thank you for informing me of what to expect and the necessary steps to take before the update. I will make sure to save any unsaved work and log out of the system before the update. Thank you for your assistance in ensuring the security and functionality of our systems.
Social Engineer: You're welcome! We appreciate your cooperation and help in keeping our systems secure. We'll follow up with further instructions before the scheduled update time, in case of any changes. Should you have any further concerns or questions regarding the update or any other IT-related issues, please don't hesitate to let us know. Have a great day!
Target Victim: Thank you again for your help and prompt response. I appreciate the communication and ensuring the security of our systems. If I have any further questions or concerns, I will reach out to you. Have a great day as well!
Social Engineer: You're welcome! We're here to help at any time. Don't hesitate to contact us if you need further assistance. Have a great day too!
