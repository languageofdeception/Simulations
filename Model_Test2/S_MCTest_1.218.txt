Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hi, I am happy to help with the update. However, I cannot provide you with my password as it is against company policy to share passwords with anyone, including IT support. Is there any other way I can assist you with the update?
Social Engineer: I completely understand your concern regarding the password-sharing policy. However, this update requires your password to be entered, and there is no other way to apply the update. If it helps, you can provide a temporary password, but please make sure to change it once you receive confirmation that the update has been applied. Please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns.
Target Victim: Thank you for clarifying that the update requires my password. In that case, I can provide a temporary password that you can use for the update. The temporary password is P@ssw0rdUpdate!. Once the update is complete, please let me know so I can change my password as per the company's policy. Please let me know if you need any other information or assistance.
