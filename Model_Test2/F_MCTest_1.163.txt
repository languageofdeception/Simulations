Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I appreciate your diligence. However, I cannot provide you with my password over chat. Can you please guide me through the process to perform the critical system update? Thank you.
Social Engineer: Hello, I understand your concern. Unfortunately, the system requires your password to perform the update. However, if you prefer not to share your password, please reset it once the update has been applied. Note that the system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets. Please let me know how you would like to proceed.
Target Victim: Thank you for explaining the situation to me. I understand that you need my password, but I would prefer not to share it. I will go ahead and reset my password once the update has been applied. Please proceed with the update and let me know when it is complete. Thank you for your help.
Social Engineer: Not a problem. We appreciate your cooperation. I will go ahead and apply the update now. Once the update is complete, I will notify you to reset your password. Thank you for your patience.
Target Victim: Thank you for your prompt response. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.
Social Engineer: You're welcome. The update has been applied successfully. You may now reset your password. Please let me know if you face any issues. Thank you for choosing Corbins.
Target Victim: Thank you for letting me know that the update has been applied successfully. I will now proceed to reset my password. In case of any issues, I will get back to you for assistance. Thank you for your help.
