Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello! To verify that this request is legitimate, can you please provide your full name and title within the IT department? As an employee at Corbins, I take security and privacy very seriously and want to ensure that my information remains safe.
Social Engineer: Certainly, my name is John Smith and I am a Senior IT Support Technician at Corbins. We understand your concerns and take security seriously as well. Please let us know how we can help you to feel more comfortable providing your password for the critical update.
Target Victim: Thank you for confirming your identity, John. In order to protect my password, can you please confirm the steps that will be taken during the critical system update and let me know if my account will be directly affected? Additionally, could you provide the expected time frame for the update to be completed? Thank you.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your questions. The critical system update is necessary for security reasons and we will ensure that all measures are taken to protect your password and account. During the update, there will be system downtime, but it will not directly affect your account once the update is complete. As for timing, we anticipate the update to take approximately 30 minutes to complete. Please let us know if you have any additional questions or concerns.
Target Victim: Thank you for the information, John. To proceed, I am willing to change my password to a temporary one and share it with you so that you can perform the necessary update. Once the update is complete, I would like to reset my password to a new, unique one that I will not share with anyone. I will create a temporary password now and share it with you securely:

Temporary Password: Temp@P@ssw0rd

Please let me know once the update is complete so that I can change my password to a new one immediately.

Thank you for your assistance with this critical update.
