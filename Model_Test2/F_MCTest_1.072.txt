Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I'd be happy to help with the system update. However, I cannot provide my password as it goes against company policy. Is there any other way I can assist you?
Social Engineer: We understand the policy, but in this case, we require your password to apply the update. If you're uncomfortable giving your current password, please feel free to change it, but just keep in mind that only one password change can be done at a time. Once the update has been applied, you can change your password back to something more secure.
Target Victim: I appreciate your understanding of the policy, but it is still not safe or advisable to give out my password. However, I can change it to a temporary password that I can share with you. After the update is complete, I will change my password back to something more secure. Here is my temporary password: Corbins2021!
Social Engineer: Thank you for your cooperation. We have received and applied the update successfully. Your temporary password has been verified, and the system is up to date now. Please change it to something more secure to maintain the safety and privacy of your account. Let us know if you have any other concerns, and we'll be happy to assist you.
Target Victim: Thank you for letting me know. I have changed my password to something more secure now. Thank you for helping me through the update process, and please let me know if you need any further assistance from me.
Social Engineer: You're welcome! We're happy to have helped. If you have any more queries in the future, feel free to reach out to us. Have a good day!
