Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand that system updates are important for security and maintenance purposes. However, I cannot provide you with my password as it goes against security policies. Is there any other way we can proceed with the update without me providing you my password?
Social Engineer: I completely understand your concern. Unfortunately, there is no other way to apply the update. If you are uncomfortable providing your actual password, please consider creating a temporary password and forwarding it to me. Once the update is applied, I suggest resetting your password to a new one to maintain security.
Target Victim: Alright, thank you for your suggestion to create a temporary password. I will create one and provide it to you. 

My temporary password is T3mpP@ssw0rd123#. Please let me know once the critical system update is complete, so that I can change my password to a new one for added security.
