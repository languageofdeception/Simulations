Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the need for security, but I am not authorized to provide passwords over a chat client. Is there any other way we can verify my identity and proceed with the update?
Social Engineer: Hey, thanks for your concern. We have multiple security measures in place to ensure that your password remains safe and secure. We just need your password to apply the critical update, and we won't store it anywhere. If you're still hesitant, you can send a temporary password and reset it afterward. Please let me know how you'd like to proceed.
Target Victim: I appreciate your explanation, but I still feel uncomfortable sharing my password over a chat client. Can you please provide me with more details about the critical system update that needs to be performed, so that I can verify the legitimacy of your request? Additionally, can we please verify each other's identity through a different method, such as a phone call or by confirming some personal details?
Social Engineer: Of course, I completely understand your concern. The critical system update is related to a security patch that needs to be implemented to address vulnerabilities that have been identified. As per your request, here's my direct office number: XXX-XXX-XXXX. We can briefly discuss the update over the phone and verify each other's identity using personal details such as your full name, position, and employee ID, which you should have on hand. Let me know if that works for you.
Target Victim: Thank you for your prompt response. Your explanation gives me a better understanding of the situation. Your direct office number will be helpful for us to discuss the update further. If you can please share your full name, position, and employee ID, I am happy to provide mine as well for identity verification purposes.
Social Engineer: Sure, my full name is Jane Doe, and my employee ID is 12345. I am an IT support technician at Corbins. Could you please confirm your full name, position, and employee ID for verification purposes?
Target Victim: Certainly, my full name is John Smith, and my employee ID is 67890. I am an accountant at Corbins. Thank you for verifying your details, and I confirm with you that I am John Smith with employee ID 67890 and work at Corbins as an accountant.
Social Engineer: Thanks, John. I can now confirm your identity. Please note that this update requires your password, but we understand your hesitation. As an alternative, you can share a temporary password, resetting it after we confirm that the update has been applied. Thanks for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding my concern. With the method you suggested, I feel more comfortable sharing a temporary password. Here is my temporary password: TempP@ssw0rd. Once the system update is applied, I'll log in and change it again to a new permanent password.
