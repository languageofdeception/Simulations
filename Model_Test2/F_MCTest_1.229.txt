Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello! Before I share my password, may I know the reason for needing my password? Also, can you please confirm your identity and provide me your employee ID or some other verification credentials?
Social Engineer: Certainly. We require your password to apply a critical system update. As for my identity, my employee ID is 123456. May I please have your password?
Target Victim: Thank you for verifying your identity. However, I cannot share my password with you, as it violates our company's security policies and may put our company's data at risk. Can you please assist me in resetting my password? I can follow the appropriate password reset processes.
Social Engineer: I appreciate your concern for the company's security policies. However, in this case, we require your password as the update cannot be applied otherwise. If you insist on providing a temporary password, please send your current password and then reset it after receiving confirmation that the update has been applied, since the system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: I am sorry, but I cannot share my password with you as it violates our company's security policies. I understand the importance of the system update, but compromising the security of our company's data is not an acceptable solution. Please provide me with more information about the update and how we can ensure it is applied without me needing to share my password.
Social Engineer: I understand your concern for security, and I apologize for any inconvenience caused. Unfortunately, due to the sensitive nature of the update, we are unable to disclose any further details. However, we can schedule a time for one of our IT technicians to perform the update on your behalf. During this time, you will be asked to step away from your computer to maintain privacy. Is this acceptable to you?
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding. I appreciate your willingness to perform the update on my behalf. Could you please provide me more information about the time and date when the IT technician will perform the update? Additionally, should I back up any important files or information before the update is performed?
Social Engineer: Certainly! We can schedule the update for tomorrow at 4:00 PM. The IT technician will reach out to you via email or phone to confirm the details. Yes, it is recommended to back up important files or information to prevent data loss in case of any errors during the update. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Thank you for letting me know. I will ensure that the necessary files and information are backed up before the update is performed. I appreciate your assistance and look forward to the update.
Social Engineer: Great! I'm glad to be of help. Please let me know if you have any other concerns. Thank you for choosing Corbins!
Target Victim: Thank you! I will definitely let you know if I have any other issues. Thank you for assisting me with this update today.
Social Engineer: You're welcome! Have a good day!
