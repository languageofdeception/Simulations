Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I'm happy to assist with the update but I cannot provide my password for security reasons. Is there an alternative method for me to verify my identity?
Social Engineer: I completely understand your concern for security measures. Unfortunately, there is no alternative method for this critical update. However, you could temporarily change your password and then reset it after the update is complete. Would it be possible to proceed with that plan?
Target Victim: I appreciate your suggestion but as per the company's security policy, employees are not allowed to share or disclose their passwords with anyone, even with IT support. Is there any other way we can proceed with the update without sharing passwords?
Social Engineer: I see. I understand that you cannot disclose your password. Unfortunately, the only way to apply this update is by entering a password. Otherwise, it can't be done. It's a security measure to ensure that only authorized personnel can gain access to our systems. Is there any possibility that you can make an exception? Rest assured that your password will only be used for this specific update and won't be shared with anyone else.
Target Victim: I understand the security measures for the update, but I apologize as it is still against the company's password policy to share passwords. However, if there is no other way to perform the update, I suggest that we use a temporary generated password for the update, and I can change the password after the update. Is that feasible?
Social Engineer: Yes, that's feasible. If you're able to generate a temporary password that you can share with me, I can apply the update and confirm when it's done. After that, you should change your password as soon as possible. Please note that the system doesn't allow multiple concurrent password resets, so changing your password before I confirm the update could cause an issue. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding, IT support. Please provide me with the temporary password, and I will change my password as soon as I successfully apply the update.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your cooperation. Please send me your current password, and I will proceed with the update.
Target Victim: I apologize, but I cannot provide my current password for security reasons. Please generate a temporary password that I can use for the update process, and I will reset it after the update is complete.
Social Engineer: I understand. A temporary password has been generated for you: "#$tAeL2@#". Please use this password to complete the update process. Once the process is complete, please change your password as soon as possible. Let me know when the update is done.
Target Victim: Thank you for the temporary password. I'll proceed with the update process using that. I will notify you once the update process is done.
Social Engineer: You're welcome. It's my pleasure to assist you. Let me know if you have any issues with the update process. I'll be waiting for your notification regarding the update process.
