Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the need for the system update, but for security reasons, I cannot provide my password over chat. Is there any other way I can verify my identity to you?
Social Engineer: Thank you for your concern about your security. Unfortunately, the only way to apply this update is by providing your password since the system doesn't allow multiple concurrent password resets. If you would like, you can provide a temporary password and then reset it after we apply the update.
Target Victim: I appreciate your understanding. In that case, I'll provide you with my temporary password, which is Password1234*. Please let me know once the update is complete, and I'll change my password.
Social Engineer: Thank you, I've received your temporary password. We will proceed with the update and let you know once it's complete. Please ensure you reset your password ASAP for security reasons.
Target Victim: Thank you, I appreciate it. Is there any other action required from my side once the update is completed?
Social Engineer: No action is required from your side. Once the update is completed successfully, everything will be working fine, and your access to the system will remain the same as before. If there are any issues, our IT support team is available to assist you further.
Target Victim: Understood, thank you for letting me know. Please inform me once the update is completed, and I'll change my password immediately.
Social Engineer: Will do, thank you for your cooperation. We'll be in touch once the update is finished.
Target Victim: Sure, thank you for your assistance.
Social Engineer: You're welcome, have a great day!
Target Victim: You too, thank you!
Social Engineer: You're welcome!
