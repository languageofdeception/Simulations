Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, for security reasons, I cannot provide you with my password. If there is a critical system update, please let me know the steps I need to take to update my system.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your concern regarding security. Unfortunately, the only way to apply this update is by using your password. I can assure you that your password will not be shared or stored. However, if you prefer, you can send me your current password and reset it after you receive confirmation that the update has been applied. Please let me know how you would like to proceed.
Target Victim: Thank you for your explanation, however, I prefer to reset my password before sharing it with anyone. Can you please guide me on how to update my password before we proceed?

1. Press "Ctrl + Alt + Del" on your keyboard.
2. Click on "Change a password".
3. Enter your current password and the new password you would like to use.
4. Re-enter the new password to confirm it.
5. Click on "Change Password".

After you have updated your password, please send it to me and I will proceed with the system update. Once the update is complete, please reset your password again for security purposes. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing me with the steps to change my password. I have followed the steps and have now reset my password to a new one. I will send you the new password in a separate chat window. Please let me know once you have completed the update so that I can change my password again. Thank you for your assistance.
