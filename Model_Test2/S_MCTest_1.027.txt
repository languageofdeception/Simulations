Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I'm sorry but I cannot provide my password as it is confidential information. Can you please provide more information about the system update and how it will affect my work?
Social Engineer: Of course, we are performing a security patch to fix a critical vulnerability in the system. Without this update, the system may become vulnerable to cyber attacks, which can lead to data loss or theft. Once the update is complete, you will be able to use the system as usual. Can you please provide your current password so we can proceed with the update? If you prefer, you can reset your password after we confirm that the update has been applied.
Target Victim: Thank you for the information. I appreciate the concern for our system's security. However, for security reasons, it is not company policy to share passwords over chat. Can you please provide me with a link or instructions to perform the update myself? I will be happy to comply with the update to secure our system.
Social Engineer: I understand your hesitation to share passwords over chat, and I appreciate your concern for security. Unfortunately, the system update requires authentication with your current password, and there is no alternative method to apply this update. However, we can suggest that you change your password immediately after we confirm that the update has been applied. Please let me know if you are willing to provide us with your current password so we can complete the update.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding my concern. I'm still not comfortable sharing my password over chat. However, I'm willing to reset my password after the update is applied. Please let me know what is the next step and when the update will be applied.
Social Engineer: Thank you for understanding our policy. To proceed, please change your password now to a temporary password that you can share with us. Once we have completed the update, you can reset your password to a personal password. Please share your temporary password with us, and we will confirm the update once complete. The update should take about 10 minutes, and we will notify you once it is complete. Thank you for your cooperation in keeping our system secure.
Target Victim: Thank you for the instruction. I have changed my password to TempP@ssw0rd123. Please let me know once the update is complete so I can reset my password to a personal one.
