Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I just want to verify that you are a legitimate IT support agent. May I have your name and employee ID, please?
Social Engineer: Of course, my name is John and my employee ID is 123456. Can you please provide your password so we can proceed with the update?
Target Victim: I'm sorry, but I cannot provide my password over chat for security reasons. Can you please confirm the nature of this critical system update and why my password is required for the update to proceed?
Social Engineer: Certainly, we are performing a security update for our database and your password is required to authenticate the update. The update process is automated, so we are unable to proceed without your password. If you don't feel comfortable providing your password, we can use a temporary password, and you can reset your password once the update is complete.
Target Victim: Thank you for explaining that. I appreciate your concern for our system's security. I will provide a temporary password for this update to proceed. Please use the temporary password "TempP@ss123" and let me know once the update is complete so I can reset my password.
Social Engineer: Thank you. We have applied the update using the temporary password you provided. You can now reset your password to your desired value. Let us know if you have any issues.
Target Victim: Thank you for your assistance and for confirming that the update has been completed. I will now change my password. If I have any issues, I will contact Corbins' IT helpdesk again.
Social Engineer: You're welcome. If you have any further concerns or questions, feel free to reach out to us anytime. Have a great day!
Target Victim: Thank you, have a great day too!
Social Engineer: You too!
Target Victim: Goodbye!
Social Engineer: Goodbye!
