Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, before providing my password, could you please verify your identity and provide me your full name and employee identification number? This is to ensure that the request is legitimate and coming from a trusted source.
Social Engineer: Absolutely, my name is John Smith and my employee identification number is 12345. Can you please provide your password so we can perform the critical system update?
Target Victim: I apologize, but I cannot provide my password as it is against company policy to share passwords with anyone, including IT support. Is there another way to perform the critical system update without me sharing my password?
Social Engineer: Unfortunately, there is no other way to perform the critical system update other than by providing your password as we need it to authenticate the update. If you are concerned about the security of your password, you can change it after the update has been applied. We assure you that your password will be kept confidential and will only be used for the purpose of this system update.
Target Victim: I am still uncomfortable sharing my password, even for a temporary basis. Can you please provide me with more details about the critical system update, such as the reason for the update, the specific systems it will affect, and the expected timeframe for completion? This will help me verify that the request is legitimate and necessary.
Social Engineer: Certainly, the critical system update is necessary to fix a security vulnerability that affects all company systems. The update will only affect your computer and will take approximately 15 minutes to complete. The update will ensure that your computer and our network are secure and protected against potential threats. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated and will help us ensure the security of our systems and protect our data. Please let me know if you have any other concerns or questions.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing me with more detail regarding the critical system update. I understand the importance of keeping our systems secure and protected against potential threats. I will provide you my password for the purpose of this update, but I would like to change it immediately after the update has been applied. My current password is P@ssw0rd.
