Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I am happy to verify my identity but I cannot share my password as it is against the company's security protocols. Is there any other way I can prove my identity?
Social Engineer: Hi, we understand your concern regarding the security of your password. However, we require your password to proceed with the critical system update. The update is time-sensitive, and we need your cooperation to ensure the update is applied on time. Would you consider providing a temporary password that you can change immediately after the system update?
Target Victim: I appreciate the urgency to apply the critical update, but unfortunately, I cannot provide my password, even a temporary one. To ensure the security of our company data and systems, passwords should only be known to individuals who are authorized to access them. Is there any other way we can proceed with the update? Perhaps we can set up a remote session where you can perform the update while I observe the process?
Social Engineer: We understand your concern for security, and creating a remote session is not possible with this update. However, could you please reset your password before we apply the update? This way, we can ensure that the password is only known to you, and the system update can be done. We would also advise that you avoid sharing your password in the future. Thank you.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding my concerns regarding the password security. I will reset my password and provide you with the new password shortly. Thank you for your help in ensuring our systems remain secure.
Social Engineer: You're welcome! Thank you for your cooperation and understanding. Once you have reset your password, please send the new temporary password over to me, and I will confirm once the critical system update has been successfully applied. Afterward, we highly recommend resetting your password again for extra security.
Target Victim: Thank you for your advice. I have reset my password to the temporary password 'T3mpP@ssw0rd'. Could you please confirm when the update is successfully applied? Afterward, I will be sure to follow your recommendation and reset my password again.
