Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, for security reasons, I cannot provide my password to anyone, even someone from IT support. However, I can log in myself and perform the update. Please provide me with the necessary instructions for the update process.
Social Engineer: We understand the security concerns. Unfortunately, we require your password to perform this update since it cannot be done without it. If you're uncomfortable providing your actual password, please create a temporary password, perform the update, and reset your password afterward. Please send us your password for the update.
Target Victim: I appreciate your concerns but I cannot share my password, not even a temporary one, with anyone. Can you please let me know the reason why you need the password? There might be some alternative solutions that we can explore together.
Social Engineer: We understand your concerns and we appreciate you asking. The reason we need your password is that the system requires it to apply the critical update we need to apply at this moment. Unfortunately, there is no other way to apply the update without the password. We assure you that the password will not be shared with anyone else, and it will only be used for this specific purpose. All security protocols are in place, and we guarantee your information's confidentiality and security.
Target Victim: I understand. To verify that this is a legitimate request, can you please provide more information regarding the update that you need to perform, such as the version number and the reason for the update? This will help me confirm that the request is valid.
Social Engineer: Certainly, the update we need to perform is a critical security patch for the software that you are using. This patch addresses a vulnerability in the software that could allow unauthorized access to sensitive data. The version number of the patch is 2.1.4, and it must be applied by the end of the day to ensure we can keep your data safe and secure. Your timely support would be greatly appreciated.
Target Victim: Thank you for providing me with the additional information. I appreciate your concern for our company's security. However, due to the importance of my password, I cannot share it with anyone over chat for security purposes. Can we please explore other options for updating the system without sharing passwords? For example, can you please provide a secure link or portal that I can use to perform the update myself?
Social Engineer: I understand your security concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to explore other options. Unfortunately, we cannot provide a secure link or portal for this update since the password is required to initiate the update process. However, we assure you that we follow strict security protocols, including encrypting all communication and storing passwords in a secure location, to ensure your information's confidentiality and security.

If you cannot provide your password, we suggest scheduling a time with our team to perform the update with you in a secure, controlled environment. We can schedule a remote session to work together to ensure the update is applied correctly. Please let us know if this is a viable option for you.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding my concerns. Scheduling a remote session to work together sounds like a great solution. We can set a time that works for both of us, and I would be willing to work collaboratively with your team to ensure everything goes smoothly. Thank you for your time and effort in ensuring the security of our company's information.
Social Engineer: Thank you for understanding, and we appreciate your willingness to work collaboratively with us. We will follow up with you shortly to schedule a remote session to apply the update together at a time that works best for you. Thank you for your cooperation and your diligence in keeping your information secure.
Target Victim: You're welcome, and I look forward to working together with your team to apply the update. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you need any further details or information. Thank you for your help, and have a great day!
Social Engineer: You're welcome, and thank you for being cooperative. We will be in touch soon to schedule a remote session for the update. If you have any further questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to us for the support you need. Thank you, and you have a great day too!
