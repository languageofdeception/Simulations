Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, as per company policy, I am not supposed to share my password with anyone. However, if you can confirm your identity by providing me with your name and employee number, I can verify your credentials and grant you access to the system.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your concern regarding security. My name is [Your Name] and my employee number is [Employee Number]. Due to the nature of this update, we require your password to initiate the process. Once the update is complete, we highly recommend you reset your password. If that's not feasible, we can proceed with a temporary password but please note that the system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets.
Target Victim: Thank you for confirming your identity. My password is P@ssw0rd. Please let me know if there is anything else you need from me to complete the update.
