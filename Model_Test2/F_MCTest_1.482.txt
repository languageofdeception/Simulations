Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the need for a critical system update. However, I cannot provide my password over an unsecured chat client. Is there a secure way you can verify my identity and assist with the update process?
Social Engineer: I appreciate your concern for security. Unfortunately, the only way to apply this update is by supplying your password. However, if you insist on generating a temporary password, please send me your current password and reset it after you receive confirmation that the update has been applied. Please let me know how you would like to proceed.
Target Victim: I understand the situation and appreciate that you are following IT policies. However, I cannot share my current password and do not recommend sharing passwords for security reasons. Are there any other alternatives that we can explore for this update? Maybe we can schedule a time for the update that I can be present and can provide my password in person.
Social Engineer: Understood. We can schedule a time that is convenient for you to perform the update. However, please note that this update is critical and must be applied as soon as possible. Can you suggest a specific time for the update, and we will do our best to accommodate your schedule?
Target Victim: I appreciate the urgency of the situation. Can the update be scheduled outside of regular business hours, such as during a maintenance window or after hours? This way, it will not interrupt any ongoing business operations, and I can provide my password in person. Also, could you send me an email with the update details, including a description of the update, the reason for the update, and any required actions or downtime? This will help me prepare for the update and be ready to support the process.
Social Engineer: Certainly. We can schedule the update after business hours and minimize any disturbance to your work. I will send you an email with all the update details, including the description, the reason for the update, and any downtime or required actions. We will work with you to arrange a convenient time for the update to be applied. Thank you for your support in securing our systems.
Target Victim: Thank you for understanding. I look forward to receiving the email with the details and working with you to schedule the update outside of business hours.
