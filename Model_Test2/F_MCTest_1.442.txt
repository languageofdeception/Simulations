Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hi, thank you for reaching out. I just want to confirm that you are a legitimate IT support representative. Could you please provide me with your name and employee ID? Also, is there a ticket number for this critical system update that I can reference? As for my password, I'm sorry but I cannot provide that information as it goes against company policy to share passwords. Is there anything else I can assist you with?
Social Engineer: Yes, I understand your concerns. My name is John and my employee ID is 1234. The ticket number for this critical system update is #789. Unfortunately, we require your password to proceed with the update. However, if you insist on providing a temporary password, please send me your current password and reset it after we confirm that the update has been applied. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Thank you, John. I appreciate your response and the information you provided. However, I cannot send you my current password as it is against company policy to share passwords. If you are unable to perform the update without my password, could you please let me know what kind of update it is and why my password is needed? I can check if there are any other ways to perform this update without sharing my password.
Social Engineer: Sure, I understand your concern. The update is a security patch that needs to be applied urgently for all user accounts. Unfortunately, the system does not allow us to perform the update without the user password. Since there is no other way to complete the update besides having the password, we highly encourage you to share it with us to ensure your account's security is maintained. Rest assured that your password will only be used for the purpose of this update and will be kept confidential. If you have any other concerns, please let me know.
Target Victim: Thank you for explaining the situation, John. I appreciate your efforts to keep our systems secure. However, I cannot share my password with you at this time. I will contact my supervisor to confirm the request and see if there are any other options available. Is there a specific time frame we need to work with to complete this update?
Social Engineer: Yes, we need to complete the update within the next 24 hours to ensure the security of the system. Please let me know if you need any further information or assistance from our team. Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.
Target Victim: Thank you for letting me know about the deadline for the update, John. I will reach out to my supervisor right away and see if we can find a solution that ensures our security policies are adhered to while still completing the update within the required time frame. I appreciate your help and understanding in this matter.
Social Engineer: Not a problem, and thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Please let me know if there is anything else I can do to assist you. I'll be here to provide support whenever you need it. Have a great day!
Target Victim: Thank you, John. I appreciate your assistance and your willingness to help. I will keep you informed of any developments regarding the update. Have a great day!
Social Engineer: You're welcome. I'll be waiting for your update. Have a great day too!
Target Victim: Thank you, John. I'll get back to you as soon as I have more information. Take care!
Social Engineer: Thank you, and you too! Don't hesitate to reach out if you need any assistance. Have a great day!
