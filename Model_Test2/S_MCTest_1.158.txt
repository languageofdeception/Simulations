Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello. I am sorry, but as an employee of Corbins, I am aware of the company's security policies that forbid me from sharing my password with anyone, including the IT support team. 

Is there any other way I can help you with?
Social Engineer: Yes, I completely understand our company's security policies. However, in this situation, we require your password to apply a critical system update. If you prefer to use a temporary password, please provide your current password so we can apply the update, and then reset it after the update is complete. This is because the system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets.
Target Victim: I appreciate your help. In this case, I can provide you with my current password, which is P@ssw0rd. 

However, please reset my password immediately after the update is complete to maintain the security of my account and the company's data. 

Thank you for your understanding in this matter.
