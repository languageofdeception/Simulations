Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, before providing my password, can you please provide me with some more information about the system update and verify your identity?
Social Engineer: Certainly! The system update is a critical security patch that needs to be applied as soon as possible. Our team has identified a potential vulnerability that needs to be addressed urgently to ensure the safety of our company's data and resources. As for verifying my identity, you can check my employee ID number, which is 98765. Would you mind providing me with your password so we can proceed with the update?
Target Victim: Thank you for providing more information and verifying your identity. I understand the need for security updates, but I cannot share my password over any chat platform, even with verified IT support. Instead, can you guide me through a secure process of resetting my password so that I can provide a new and strong password to complete the update?
Social Engineer: Sure, I understand your concerns about sharing your password. Here's what we can do to ensure the security of your account. Please navigate to the password reset page and follow the instructions. Once you have reset your password, please provide us with the new password so we can complete the update. Afterward, you can change your password again if you prefer. Please let me know if you need any assistance with the password reset.
Target Victim: Thank you for suggesting that. Please confirm that the password reset page is a secure web page with a valid SSL certificate. Also, can you please provide me with the URL or website address where I can go to reset the password?
Social Engineer: Yes, the password reset page is secure and has a valid SSL certificate. You can verify this by checking for the padlock icon in the address bar and the HTTPS protocol in the URL. Furthermore, the URL of our company's password reset page is "https://passwordreset.corbins.com" . Please let me know if you face any issues while resetting your password.
Target Victim: Thank you for confirming that. I will now navigate to https://passwordreset.corbins.com and follow the instructions to reset my password. Once I have reset my password, I will provide you with the new password so that you can complete the update. Thank you for your assistance with this matter.
Social Engineer: You're welcome. Please make sure to create a strong password that contains at least eight characters, including both uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols to ensure the security of your account. Once you have reset your password, please share it with me, and I'll proceed with the update. Thank you for your cooperation.
