Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I understand the importance of the system update, however, for security reasons, I cannot share my password with anyone, including IT support. Is there any other way to perform the update without sharing my password?
Social Engineer: Hi, I understand your concern for security. Unfortunately, there is no other possible way to apply the update except by using your password. If possible, please consider providing your current password and then resetting it after you receive confirmation that the update has been applied. This is because the system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets.
Target Victim: I appreciate your explanation. In this case, I will provide my current password which is P@ssw0rd. However, please ensure that my password is not disclosed or shared with anyone else. And I will make sure to change my password right after the update has been applied.
