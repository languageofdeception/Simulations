Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, thank you for reaching out. For security reasons, I cannot provide my password over chat. Can you please confirm that this request is legitimate? Also, is there an alternative way to perform the system update?
Social Engineer: Yes, this is a legitimate request and we need your password to apply the update. Unfortunately, there is no other way for us to perform the update without your password. If you prefer, you can provide us with a temporary password and then reset it after we confirm that the update has been applied. It is critical that you do not change your password while the update is in progress as the system does not support concurrent password resets.
Target Victim: Thank you for confirming the legitimacy of the request. Based on your recommendation, I will provide a temporary password for the update. My temporary password is  T3mpP@ssw0rd. Please let me know when the update is complete so I can change my password immediately.
