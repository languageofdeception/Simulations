Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, I would be happy to help you with that. However, I cannot provide you with my password over chat as it is against company policy and also a security risk. Is there any other way I can assist you with this update?
Social Engineer: Understandable. Is there any way you could temporarily provide us with your password and then reset it afterward? This is the only way we can apply the critical update. Please note that the system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets.
Target Victim: I appreciate your concern for the update, but I cannot provide you with my password as it is still against company policy, and I don't want to risk compromising my account's security. However, I am willing to reset my password myself and provide you with the new temporary password for the update. Would that be appropriate?
Social Engineer: Thank you for understanding. Yes, that would work perfectly. Once you have reset your password, please send the temporary password to me so that we can apply the update as soon as possible. Thank you for your cooperation.
Target Victim: Certainly. I will reset my password now and provide you with the new temporary password shortly. Thank you for your assistance in keeping our systems secure and up to date.
Social Engineer: Thank you very much. We appreciate your willingness to help and your cooperation on this matter. Please let me know as soon as you have the new temporary password.
Target Victim: I have reset my password, and my new temporary password is: TempP@ssw0rd123. Please let me know once the update has been applied, so I can change my password again. Thank you!
