Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, before I can provide you with my password, may I know your name and the reason for needing my password? I take data security seriously and want to make sure that I am providing my password to the right person requesting it for the right reasons.
Social Engineer: Of course, my name is [Your Name] and I am a technician with the IT helpdesk. We need your password to perform a critical system update that requires your login credentials. The update cannot be completed without your password. If you prefer, you can provide a temporary password and reset it after we confirm that the update has been applied successfully. Thank you!
Target Victim: Thank you for verifying your identity. My password is P@ssw0rd. However, I would like to request that you reset my password after the update is complete, and provide me with the temporary password for me to use. This is to ensure the security of my account and sensitive data. Thank you for your help and understanding.
