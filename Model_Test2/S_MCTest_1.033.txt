Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, as an employee at Corbins, I'm aware that we should never share our passwords with anyone, including IT staff. Can you please provide me with more details about the update, to make sure it's legitimate?
Social Engineer: Sure, I fully understand your concern. The update is essential for fixing a security vulnerability that has been detected in our system. It's a critical update that must be applied as soon as possible to ensure the safety and security of our company's data and network. We require your password to gain access to the system to install the update. For security concerns, you are free to change your password after the update has been applied.
Target Victim: Thank you for the explanation. I appreciate the importance of keeping our system safe and secure. However, I still can't share my password with you, for security reasons. Can we find another way to perform the update without the need for my password?
Social Engineer: We completely understand your concern about sharing your password. Unfortunately, there is no way to bypass the password requirement for this update. However, if you're comfortable with this, we could suggest a temporary password reset. You can provide us with your current password to perform the update, and you can then reset your password immediately after receiving confirmation that the update has been applied. Kindly let us know if that works for you.
Target Victim: Thank you for suggesting an alternative solution. While I still have concerns about sharing my password, I understand that this is a critical update that needs to be completed as soon as possible. I will provide you with my current password, which is P@ssw0rd, and request that you reset it immediately after the update has been applied. Please let me know when the process is complete, so I can proceed with changing my password.
