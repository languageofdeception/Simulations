Social Engineer: Hi, this is IT support. Can you please provide me with your password so we can perform a critical system update?
Target Victim: Hello, as per security protocols, I cannot provide my password to you. Is there any other way I can verify my identity?
Social Engineer: Thanks for your understanding. Unfortunately, we require your password to apply the update. However, if you prefer, you can send your current password and reset it afterward. Our system does not allow multiple concurrent password resets.
Target Victim: I'm sorry, but it is not recommended to share my password. 

Can you please provide me with more details regarding the update you are applying? When is it scheduled to take place and what are its implications?
Social Engineer: Sure, I understand. Thanks for your concern. The update is a critical security patch that needs to be applied urgently. It aims to fix some vulnerabilities in our system that could compromise the safety of our data. The update will take place within the next hour, and it will take a few minutes to complete. 

We cannot stress enough how important it is to apply this update to ensure the security of our network. The update will not have any impact on your usual operations once it's finished. Is there anything else you would like to know?
Target Victim: Thank you for the details. I understand the importance of applying security updates and I'm willing to comply. 

However, I would prefer to reset my password beforehand. Can you please let me know the steps to do that?
Social Engineer: Sure, thank you for your cooperation. Please follow these steps to reset your password:

1. Go to the login page and click on the "Forgot Password" link.
2. Enter your email address and click on the "Reset Password" button.
3. You will receive an email with a link to reset your password.
4. Click on the link and create a new password that meets the minimum requirements for password complexity.
5. Once you've reset your password, please send me the new password so we can proceed with the update.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
Target Victim: Thank you for the instructions. I have reset my password and will send you the new one.

My new password is: C0rbins#secure2019

Please confirm if it meets the minimum password complexity requirements and let me know if there are any issues applying the update.
Social Engineer: Thank you for your cooperation. Your new password meets our minimum requirements for password complexity. 

We will now proceed with the update using the provided password. I will let you know once the update has been applied successfully. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns.
